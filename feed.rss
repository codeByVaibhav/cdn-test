        The breakthrough agreement, brokered by the UN and Turkey, and signed by representatives from Russia and Ukraine in July, promised to unblock ports on the Black Sea to allow the safe passage of grain and oilseeds, following routes identified by Ukrainian maritime pilots to avoid mines, and with stops in Istanbul to ensure weapons are not being smuggled back into the country.

        The deal followed months of diplomacy and sparked hopes around the world after the Russian blockade of Ukrainian ports pushed grain commodity prices to record highs this year as more than 20 million metric tons of Ukraine's wheat and corn remained trapped in Odesa.

        After meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the western city of Lviv on Thursday, Guterres said there were signs that global food markets were beginning to stabilize in the wake of the agreement.

        "It is time for massive and generous support so developing countries can purchase the food from this and other ports -- and people can buy it. Developing countries need access to financing -- now. They need debt relief -- now. They need resources to invest in their people -- now," he added.

        Today's crisis is far worse than the previous food price spikes of 2007 to 2008 and 2010 to 2012, which both fueled riots around the world, including revolutions in the Middle East.

        Food security experts have warned of huge geopolitical risk if action is not taken. This year has already witnessed political destabilization in "Sri Lanka, Mali, Chad, Burkina Faso, riots and protests taking place in Kenya, Peru, Pakistan, Indonesia ... these are only signs things to come is going to get worse," Beasley said.

<p>As a result of the growing pace of technological development, digital currencies are quickly establishing themselves in the global market. Being the flag bearer, cryptocurrency is the talk of the town and has been expanding at an increasing rate since 2015. As a result, cryptocurrency has developed a sizable fan base, many of whom view it as a profitable investment and even as the future.</p>



<p>In this blog, let&#8217;s learn about cryptocurrency and its two sides.</p>



<h2>What is Cryptocurrency?</h2>



<p>A digital asset called cryptocurrency is created and traded through the use of cryptography. It differs from fiat currency like metal coins or paper currency since it is made using complex computer codes.</p>



<ul><li>Unlike traditional money, it is basically intangible and cannot literally be handled or stored.</li><li>It&#8217;s a virtual currency, a different type of payment system is developed with an encryption algorithm.</li><li>It is governed by a decentralized network of data ledgers and <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-will-blockchain-technology-impact-the-retail-industry/" data-wpel-link="internal">blockchains</a> rather than a single body.</li></ul>



<h2>Advantages of Cryptocurrency</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Keeps a check on inflation</strong></li></ul>



<p>Many currencies have seen a decrease in their value over time due to inflation. Most cryptocurrencies have a set amount when they are initially introduced. The amount of any coin is specified in the source code; for example, there were only 21 million Bitcoins published worldwide. Therefore, when demand rises, its value will also increase, keeping up with the market and preventing inflation.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Decentralized</strong></li></ul>



<p>The fact that cryptocurrencies are primarily decentralized is a crucial benefit. In contrast to fiat currencies, which the government regulates, cryptocurrencies are decentralized, which helps keep the currency monopoly neutral and in balance so that no one entity can control the movement and value of the coin.</p>



<ul><li><strong>A fast way to transfer funds</strong></li></ul>



<p>Cryptocurrencies are considered the best option for a transaction and have consistently maintained that position. This is because they enable instantaneous domestic and international transactions. This is due to the fact that the verification process only takes a short time because there aren&#8217;t many obstacles to overcome.</p>



<h2>Disadvantages of Cryptocurrency</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Decentralized but still operated by some organization</strong></li></ul>



<p>The <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-a-decentralized-money-market/" data-wpel-link="internal">decentralized</a> nature of cryptocurrency is well-known. However, some currencies&#8217; issuers and organizations continue to control the circulation and supply of some of these currencies. These holders have the power to prevent the coin&#8217;s price from significant fluctuations.</p>



<ul><li><strong>The adverse impact of mining on the environment</strong></li></ul>



<p>Cryptocurrency mining is a very energy-intensive process requiring much computing and electricity consumption. For instance, Bitcoin; Bitcoin mining uses a lot of energy and sophisticated computers, and it cannot be done with standard computers.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Susceptible to hacks</strong></li></ul>



<p>Cryptocurrencies are highly secure, but some exchanges are not. Most exchanges keep track of their wallet information to maintain users&#8217; IDs. Hackers may be able to access numerous accounts by stealing this data. These hackers can quickly move funds from those accounts once they have access.</p>



<h2>The Top-Down View</h2>



<p>Despite all the on-ramps that have been put in place, crypto markets are still in their infancy from an institutional standpoint. An asset class is deemed immature by an institution if its markets are less liquid and fragmented than those of its established counterparts. They are therefore simpler to control and more difficult to manipulate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, from a business organization standpoint, cryptography&#8217;s permissionless and open source nature is another clear challenge that needs to be overcome. When looking at crypto from this angle, issues like &#8220;How do you construct walled gardens when the core technology is deliberately concerned with its circumvention?&#8221; naturally arise.</p>



<p>Regulators must also be on the leading edge of what is technically possible due to cryptocurrency, which is a more significant challenge than the role they have been playing up to this point. It&#8217;s challenging enough to keep up with financial innovation in established markets.</p>



<p>To create a finished, regulated financial product for the centralized, top-down market, businesses must first take an institutional client&#8217;s idea. This calls for the creation of tools for the continuing management of all those previously described, a systematic methodology, and the gathering and refining data.</p>



<h2>The Bottom-Up View</h2>



<p>In this view, it&#8217;s critical to recognize that you are dealing with a combination of concerns and preconceptions in contrast to much of what has come before. From a bottom-up perspective, however, even Bitcoin&#8217;s status as a bearer asset is a feature rather than a bug, contrary to what some institutional mindsets would have. Moreover, do not forget that Bitcoin was developed in response to the long-standing monetary excesses committed by central banks.</p>



<p>Decentralized systems inevitably grow more dispersed and haphazardly. Therefore, when the data provider looks at the landscape from the bottom up, there are many possibilities to see what high-quality data may bring to the table. These opportunities, however, are of a very different nature.</p>



<h2>Conclusion: What does the future behold?</h2>



<p>We are witnessing a fascinating evolutionary conflict between top-down and bottom-up approaches to consensus building and centralized versus decentralized methods of organization and justice. It is an evolutionary process because the two systems are evolving independently in a fuzzy environment where the definition of &#8220;best fit&#8221; is a shifting objective.</p>

<p>Money has always been borrowed and lent extensively in both economic activity and the economy. Borrowers take loans to accomplish a wide range of purposes, from satisfying primary consumer needs to making investments. Lenders make money available for either a fixed or variable interest rate.</p>



<p>Not just conventional money markets allow for the borrowing and lending of assets. The development of <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/6-ways-to-save-yourself-from-defi-scams-in-2022/" data-wpel-link="internal">Decentralized Finance</a> (DeFi) allows people to borrow and lend their crypto assets with just a few clicks.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s learn about what is a decentralized money market and what are some of its benefits.</p>



<h2>What is a decentralized money market?</h2>



<p>A decentralized money market is a market structure that uses several technologies, such as a smart contract, to allow investors, lenders, and borrowers to establish a non-centralized market structure. It is powered by Blockchain technology. They all can trade freely under this market arrangement since no physical market structure has been formed; instead, they employ a range of web3 technologies.</p>



<p>A decentralized money market establishes a network of technological platforms and software that buyers, sellers, and lenders can use to transact, access ask prices, and engage in other market activities.</p>



<p>Decentralized nodes manage the on-chain programmatic code that investors, lenders, and borrowers use to conduct their business, thus breaking the monopoly of a single company in charge and minimizing potential points of failure.</p>



<p>Before we move forward, let&#8217;s have a quick overview of the reasons why this money market is widely gaining traction and how it is used:</p>



<ul><li>Decentralized marketplaces improve communication and confidence between participants of transactions.</li><li>The market system&#8217;s accounts are impenetrable and secure.</li><li>It gives investors the option to trade without the presence of a regulatory body, contrary to centralized markets.</li><li>The market structure is favorable for those who have embraced technological advancements.</li><li>The market is perfect for blockchain and crypto trading.</li><li>It provides investors access to and control over their money.</li></ul>



<p>Now, let&#8217;s learn about some benefits of the decentralized money market that makes it unique and widely popular.</p>



<h2>Benefits of decentralized money market</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Permissionless</strong></li></ul>



<p>In a decentralized ecosystem, users are not required to seek permission from a centralized authority before engaging in any money market activity. As a result, anyone can easily borrow money for their requirements online and earn interest on their capital. In addition, the structure of decentralized protocols is inherently censorship-resistant.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Non-custodial</strong></li></ul>



<p>Users&#8217; money is held in centralized money markets&#8217; central gatekeeper&#8217;s possession. DeFi protocols, like money markets, are non-custodial, and lenders and borrowers have direct control over their funds. At the same time, consumers maintain complete control over their funds, on-chain smart contracts that follow pre-defined logic guarantee that cannot be compromised.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Overcollateralized</strong></li></ul>



<p>Historically, fractional reserves and under-collateralization have been the norm for centralized financial markets. These marketplaces allow borrowers to withdraw more money than they have deposited as security because of peer pressure to attract new business. Over-collateralization is followed by decentralized money markets, which stabilize the system. Simply put, the smart contract liquidates the collateral of defaulting borrowers.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Composability</strong></li></ul>



<p>A design element called composability enables system units to communicate with one another. Different applications and protocols can communicate with each other without requiring permission. DeFi programs can be assembled separately, opening up a world of unique mechanisms like yield extraction and complex derivatives.</p>



<h2>What does the future behold for a decentralized money market?</h2>



<p>The DeFi protocols have offered consumers a rewarding alternative in a setting where they are cautious of self-serving biases in centralized money markets. The former displays a blockchain-based ecosystem in line with its fundamental decentralized ethos and generally grants governance powers to everyone holding native currency.</p>



<p>Novel projects are now concentrating on altcoins to unlock the value that has been locked there, much like the money markets that previously focused on well-known cryptocurrency projects with large market capitalizations. As a result, it can be predicted that future DeFi money market protocols will likely venture into uncharted territory.</p>



<h2>Final thoughts</h2>



<p>Decentralized <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/4-investing-tips-during-the-bear-market/" data-wpel-link="internal">money markets</a> serve as an essential foundation upon which the DeFi ecosystem&#8217;s advanced financial solutions can be constructed. Even if borrowing and lending are effective on their own, they are even more effective when combined with other DeFi &#8220;money legos&#8221; to produce a more effective whole than the sum of its parts. In addition to expanding in liquidity and offering more opportunities and services to more users, these money markets will grow in size and be at the forefront of DeFi innovation as yields in the real-world economy become more unpredictable. Decentralized money markets definitely have a more promising future than ever.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, one of the most considerable technical advances in recent years has been the development of Cryptocurrencies, the brand new class of digital assets. The Cryptocurrency <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-will-blockchain-technology-impact-the-travel-tourism-industry/" data-wpel-link="internal">industry</a> has been crucial in promoting various vital advancements, notably in 2021. Cryptocurrencies have undergone three key stages to achieve spectacular development: adaptation, innovation, and integration.</p>



<p>But it&#8217;s also critical to consider the potential of Cryptocurrencies and what that means for all of us. So what significant developments in the Cryptocurrency space can you anticipate in the coming future? Let&#8217;s find out a few unexpected and weird predictions about Cryptocurrencies in this blog.</p>



<h2>1. Cryptocurrency can be mainstream.</h2>



<p>Cryptocurrency is already recognized as a valid mode of payment in several countries across the world. However, it has still not developed to the point where we can refer to it as a widely used form of money. Nevertheless, players in the industry are relatively hopeful that this may happen shortly.</p>



<p>Bitcoin is currently accepted by various eCommerce platforms, banks, and online gaming sites. In addition, several payment gateway providers also accept bitcoin payments on their platforms.</p>



<p>And very soon, Bitcoin may be the currency of choice for cross-border transactions. However, it is noteworthy that many banks were first resistant to Cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies are garnering more and more interest from modern consumers. For maintaining a competitive edge, meeting clients&#8217; needs is essential. We may soon be able to declare that Cryptocurrencies are currently mainstream!</p>



<h2>2. The metaverse may NOT rise.</h2>



<p>Although the metaverse is a hot topic, the majority of people have no clue what it truly entails.</p>



<p>In simple terms, the metaverse is basically &#8220;an interconnected network of 3D virtual worlds.&#8221; Users can enter these worlds through a <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/metaverse-vs-virtual-reality/" data-wpel-link="internal">Virtual Reality</a> (VR) headset. To navigate in the metaverse, they can use their eye movements, be a feedback controller, or give voice instructions. The user is immersed by the headgear, producing a phenomenon called presence, which is gained by simulating the actual physical experience of being present.</p>



<p>In theory, a wide range of applications could be incorporated into the metaverse, such as games, video conferencing tools, services for granting driver&#8217;s licenses, or anything else.</p>



<p>This proves that the metaverse is not a relatively new phenomenon. However, interoperability is a challenge that requires urgent attention. The ability to quickly transfer digital products across games or a digital identity without being bound to a particular platform would have been a beneficial feature.</p>



<p>The metaverse might not, however, be able to meet all requirements. Some services shouldn&#8217;t even be included in the metaverse.</p>



<p>According to the cyberpunk movement of the 1980s and 1990s, the metaverse implied complete immersion. Virtual reality glasses are currently thought to be the only way to achieve this level of immersion. Most regular folks would never don these spectacles, only to contact their grandma or trade some Cryptocurrency in an exchange.</p>



<p>A technological innovation advancement like smart contact lenses is necessary for true immersion. However, it is improbable that this technology will be extensively employed five years from now.</p>



<h2>3. The ranking of at least half of the top 50 Cryptocurrencies may worsen.</h2>



<p>The likelihood of a significant shift in the top Cryptocurrency ranking is considerable. Outright zombies like Ethereum Classic (ETC) can be eliminated from the list, and projects that now appear to be placed at the top of the list may not only be overthrown but also completely disappear.</p>



<p>Undoubtedly, certain stablecoins will decline. They will be replaced with fresh ones. Due to their agonizingly slow movement, certain top coins can drop down the list and formally turn into a living corpse.</p>



<h2>4. Crypto wallets can be the new &#8220;super apps.&#8221;</h2>



<p>These days, decentralized finance (DeFi) user needs to deal with hundreds of protocols. There are hundreds of them, and the number is increasing every day. Among them are wallets, interfaces, exchanges, bridges, and lending protocols. Even for experienced users, coping with a list of technologies can get annoying.</p>



<p>It is always seen as ideal when the maximum number of services can be accessible by a limited number of universal apps, regardless of whether the user is advanced. The best choice is when the applications are already included in their wallet.</p>



<p>For users, it becomes irrelevant which exchange or bridge they use. Instead, they care about efficiency, security, and affordable prices. As a result, many <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/6-ways-to-save-yourself-from-defi-scams-in-2022/" data-wpel-link="internal">DeFi protocols</a> will ultimately evolve into back-ends that support well-known wallets and interfaces.</p>



<h2>Final words</h2>



<p>The Cryptocurrency sector has a lot to offer. These predictions indicate that more businesses will undoubtedly adopt Cryptocurrencies, making them mainstream. This technology has already had an influence on the entire world.</p>



<p>However, the sector is still plagued by a lack of sufficient Crypto security. If the players work together to develop and stabilize the ecosystem, this can be eliminated easily.</p>

<p>Dear Tribe,</p>



<p>In light of recent developments, we understand you are worried and have your set of apprehensions. But please be assured that all your assets &#8211; Crypto &amp; INR are safe on WazirX. Our operations are being conducted as usual. To maintain transparency, our founder and CEO, Nischal Shetty, has clarified multiple points openly as well.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">All user assets &#8211; Crypto &amp; INR on WazirX are safe<br><br>WazirX has always ensured KYC is conducted, AML policies are in place<br><br>We only allow bank transfers so everything is traceable<br><br>WazirX to Binance transfer is recorded in our database ALWAYS and it’s ONLY between users own account</p>&mdash; Nischal (Shardeum) <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/26a1.png" alt="⚡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@NischalShetty) <a href="https://twitter.com/NischalShetty/status/1555775991628316674?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">August 6, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>While fear, uncertainty, and doubt are natural in these times, we request you to keep calm and remember one thing &#8211; Why you trusted us and the idea of Crypto in the first place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our solid fundamentals and the desire to make crypto accessible to all Indians has and will remain intact. Be assured that we are cooperating tirelessly with all Law Enforcement Agencies and are in conversations with stakeholders for the next steps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While HODLing, transferring, or liquidating is your choice, we request you to not make any hasty decisions due to the unsolicited coverage. As you are aware, Crypto is in its early years and is a highly volatile asset. It’s obvious that entities and folks associated with this promising asset class will have to face the brunt. We strongly believe that this too shall pass and अच्छे दिन आएंगे। However, without your support, cooperation, and patience, this will be impossible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the current scenario is challenging, you know what the good part is? As a community, we have seen people come closer. Thank You to everyone standing by our side. Your support means a lot to us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the flip side, we also noticed that users are opting to withdraw their funds to international exchanges. However, in the process, they may unknowingly be non-compliant. Here is why we say so:</p>



<p>As you are aware, from 1 July 2022, tax as TDS has to be deducted on crypto transactions. Simply put, It is mandatory for the buyer (whether a resident of India or not) to deduct 1% (5% in some cases) of the amount paid to the Indian seller for transactions more than Rs.10,000. This tax deduction must be made at the time of credit of the sum to the account of the resident or at the time of payment, whichever is earlier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, it is important to note that International exchanges do not have Indian TDS frameworks in place. Also, most of them have no visibility over the user&#8217;s real identity or the scale of transactions. Because of this, the onus of deducting and depositing TDS is on the individual/buyer/user, which is nearly impossible.</p>



<p>On the other hand, to support our users, we have scaled up our systems. We incorporated the TDS mechanism as per the Government’s notification from day one of implementation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hence we request you to ponder over these regulations and our hard work, not panic and take the right decision.</p>



<p>We would like to reiterate that your funds are safe with us, and we wish to continue to serve you. Do keep supporting us like you always do.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ve likely heard of &#8220;Bitcoin maximalism&#8221; as a crypto enthusiast. It is a phrase that has developed from a group of people who are fiercely committed to their technological and ideological beliefs. A Bitcoin maximalist, in other words, has the firm opinion that Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency and is not less than money that is significant.</p>



<p>Most maximalists firmly believe that altcoins (any cryptocurrency that is not Bitcoin) are ethically dubious and have technological flaws.</p>



<p>In this blog, let&#8217;s discover this interesting concept of Bitcoin maximalism.</p>



<h2>The &#8220;bigger picture,&#8221; according to Bitcoin maximalists.</h2>



<p>One factor that sets Bitcoin maximalists apart from the rest of the community is the fact that they go beyond the technical benefits of the blockchain and consider <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/say-hello-to-bart-simpson-that-affects-the-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a> to be a currency and technology with significant consequences for monetary economics, censorship, and governance.</p>



<p>In other words, regardless of its current value, Bitcoin&#8217;s revolutionary nature stems from its fundamental design.</p>



<h2>Their faith in the future</h2>



<p>Although Bitcoin has the largest market cap and is the most widely used decentralized cryptocurrency, it is by no means the most efficient. The coin still has significant problems with energy efficiency and scaling.</p>



<p>Despite these current issues, maximalists feel that Bitcoin will inevitably become the most coveted, dependable, and commonplace form of money in the future. Similar to how gold contributed to the development of the modern financial system through the use of the gold standard and fractional reserve banks, Bitcoin will be the &#8220;digital gold&#8221; of the future.</p>



<p>Until now, you must have a fair idea of what we have discussed. So let&#8217;s have a look at the definition.</p>



<h2>Bitcoin maximalism: Definition</h2>



<p>Bitcoin maximalists believe that the most well-known cryptocurrency in the world, Bitcoin, is considered to be the only virtual asset that will ever be required. Therefore, they think Bitcoin is superior to all other digital currencies. According to the maximalist ideology, other cryptocurrencies do not adhere to the standards set by the pseudonymous <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/an-ode-to-satoshi-nakamoto-the-legend-of-our-times/" data-wpel-link="internal">Satoshi Nakamoto</a>, who originated Bitcoin in the year 2009.</p>



<p>Unlike fiat currencies that are issued by the government, which are controlled by a single entity, bitcoin is decentralized. As a result of Bitcoin&#8217;s decentralized nature and blockchain&#8217;s status as a publicly distributed ledger, participants can see and understand all transactions.</p>



<p>Despite being a widely traded digital asset, Bitcoin has also sparked the development of several new cryptocurrencies. However, these other cryptocurrencies, known as altcoins, are considered redundant and inferior by Bitcoin maximalists.</p>



<h2>What do Bitcoin maximalists believe?</h2>



<ul><li>The world&#8217;s first operational non-state monetary system is Bitcoin, creation of computer science. Under their existence, all other cryptocurrencies are in direct competition with bitcoin; none of them provide long-term benefits without trade-offs.</li><li>To safeguard consumers, investing in other crypto is wrong and foolish. As a result, it should be socially disapproved of and avoided.</li><li>The sole restriction on Bitcoin is human ingenuity. Bitcoin or a centralized financial alternative can accomplish all that other cryptocurrencies can.</li></ul>



<h2>Overcoming key challenges</h2>



<p>While the Bitcoin maximalist ideology will always exist, network inefficiencies cannot be ignored. However, some solutions assist in addressing some of these issues, like the scalability issues with Bitcoin. In addition, the pace of technological adoption is still somewhat modest, particularly among well-known merchants. However, if the Bitcoin maximalists are to be believed, then all of that will change and get better in the future.</p>



<p>The current state of BTC&#8217;s volatility is another source of worry. Despite being the most valuable and popular cryptocurrency, it is less suitable for payments due to its volatile value. Maximalists of bitcoin will point out that less volatility will result from more usage of BTC. Similar reasoning holds true for smart contracts, which are now widely available on Bitcoin through cloud-based solutions, enhancing the technology stock of the most popular cryptocurrency.</p>



<h2>Future of Bitcoin maximalism</h2>



<p>Bitcoin maximalists would assert that all problems with the Bitcoin blockchain are actively being worked on and can be resolved. In the long run, bitcoin maximalists&#8217; chances of success will probably depend on how governments, businesses, and investors decide to use the blockchain compared to the numerous alternative possibilities. However, it appears that there will be a wide variety of cryptocurrencies for many years to come, given the investment in other networks and cryptocurrencies.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Bitcoin has undoubtedly made a name for itself as &#8220;digital gold.&#8221; 2019 witnessed the highest level of institutional investment in cryptocurrencies, most of which went to Bitcoin. Although there are strong reasons in favor of Bitcoin being the dominant cryptocurrency of the future, there is still some dissent over whether it will be the sole cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>The crypto sector is rife with eccentric personalities, controversy, and memes. The &#8220;Bart&#8221; or &#8220;Bart Simpson&#8221; chart pattern is one such meme that periodically surfaces on Bitcoin price charts.</p>



<p>But what precisely is the Bart pattern, and why does it show up on Bitcoin and other crypto price charts so often? Let&#8217;s learn about this concept in this blog.</p>



<h2>Origin of the Bart pattern</h2>



<p>Bart Simpson patterns first appeared in the 2018 Bitcoin bear market, when volume and liquidity started to decline owing to dwindling interest in the asset class. As the crypto prices fell again, the volume also diminished to its lowest levels in a year, proceeded in a low-liquidity, a low-volume trading environment that is ideal for Bart movements to reappear as a frequent trading strategy.</p>



<h2>What is the Bart Pattern?</h2>



<p>The name is inspired by &#8216;The Simpsons&#8217; character Bart Simpson.</p>



<p>Bart typically shows up during slow trading sessions when there don&#8217;t seem to be any price changes. He awakens the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/bitcoin-and-inflation-why-is-the-premiere-cryptocurrency-a-hedge/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin market</a> with a significant rise upward or downward, a significant purchasing or selling order.</p>



<p>After the spike, everything returns to normal, and the price stays at the new level for a while, generally a few days. Due to Bart&#8217;s character as a practical joker, the consolidation is just the quiet before the next, much more significant spike.</p>



<p>Bart will exit the stage with a motion downhill if the first movement is upward. If the spike turned out to be a dump, Bart would grab the money with an even greater pump.</p>



<p>Why specifically Bart? Because the chart pattern&#8217;s stated consolidation phase resembles the shape of Bart&#8217;s head.</p>



<h2>Understanding Bart Pattern</h2>



<p>Both crypto and non-crypto assets are susceptible to the Bart pattern. Because the asset&#8217;s price pattern resembles the form of Bart Simpson&#8217;s famous head, it is given the moniker &#8220;Barts.&#8221;</p>



<p>It is helpful to be able to see this pattern since it has a significant impact on short- and medium-term trading positions. It manifests as a result of several hundred Bitcoin orders placed in a couple of minutes, which may alter the coin&#8217;s price. While it may happen to any cryptocurrency, it primarily concerns Bitcoin for several reasons. One such factor is the significant volatility that Bitcoin experiences regularly, as well as the fact that sudden changes in BTC value may have an impact on the whole altcoin market.</p>



<p>These short pumps and dumps are caused by market manipulation, which will likely penalize short- and long-term cryptocurrency margin traders. Due to the absence of rules, it&#8217;s certainly feasible for the exchanges to do this. Still, it may also be the work of significant cryptocurrency traders known as &#8220;whales.&#8221;</p>



<p>The pattern can also occur in reverse, producing an upside-down picture of Bart&#8217;s head with the drop coming first and the spike following. A bullish consolidation pattern is what this is.</p>



<p>Understanding the effect of this pattern on the market is something new, and an experienced investor should not avoid it. Let&#8217;s have a quick overview of this.</p>



<h2>Effect of Bart pattern on the market</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Bitcoin ETF: </strong>These events, along with others, is probably a factor in the SEC&#8217;s continued opposition to approving <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/exchange-traded-funds-etfs-what-you-should-know-about-them/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin ETFs</a>. Contrary to what traders and investors may think, the crypto market is still small and susceptible to manipulation. Analysts say the crypto markets are sometimes the &#8220;whales&#8217; playground&#8221; since they can fluctuate at any time.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Miner Affection:</strong> The miners continue to work, especially during a weak market in crypto like the one we had in 2018. They rely on rewards to cover their electricity bills and maintain their mining rigs because their objective is to make money by assisting with the upkeep of the Bitcoin blockchain. However, as the low prices of BTC sometimes fall short of covering their essential expenses, price manipulation may also have an impact on them.</li></ul>



<p>To conclude this article, let&#8217;s look at some trading tips to survive the Bart pattern.</p>



<h2>Conclusion: Trading tips for surviving Barts</h2>



<ul><li>The Barts will impact you less if you are going for the middle or long-term trading periods.</li><li>Short-term traders may wish to have additional stop loss orders or liquidation prices as they frequently initiate margin positions on well-known cryptocurrency exchanges.</li><li>Think about the possibility of a Bart swiftly taking the price in the other direction if you notice a big move that is then followed by consolidation.</li></ul>

<p></p>



<p><br>WazirX is a platform co-operated by Zanmai Labs Pvt. Ltd. (Zanmai Labs) and Binance. Zanmai Labs has a no-tolerance policy towards any illegal activities using WazirX. Users agree in the User Agreement to use WazirX in accordance with applicable law. Users are signed up on WazirX only after they complete the KYC process, including submitting proof of address and identity. Our KYC/AML terms and processes are available on the platform publicly. For every transaction, we are able to produce the KYC details of the relevant user. We do not accept any cash transactions. We have fully cooperated with the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for several days and have responded to all their queries fully and transparently. ED appears to be investigating the transactions of certain users and Zanmai Labs has no affiliation to such users and is unaware about the purpose of their transactions. Zanmai Labs is in the position of any other intermediary whose platform may have been misused.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Secondly, there seems to be a major misunderstanding about off-chain transactions between WazirX and Binance. Off-chain transactions between WazirX and Binance can only be done by a user between his/her/its own account on the two platforms. Hence, KYC details are available for all off-chain transfers as well [and have been submitted to the ED when requested]. Off-chain withdrawals also cannot happen if the accounts are not KYCed. Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) can get complete information about the accounts involved in off-chain transfers.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Zanmai Labs has always cooperated completely with LEAs and provided full and complete information and shall continue to do so.</p>

<p>The traditional insurance business model in India has shown to be surprisingly durable throughout the years. The sector is a fascinating mix of old and new. Many major conventional companies started as premiums paid to insurance companies for the right to indemnify others. However, as new technologies alter how customers interact with businesses and how goods and services are provided, traditional insurance is starting to feel the digital effect. </p>



<p>We have curated a list of industries that can benefit from Blockchain technology. You can check all the blogs here:</p>

<p>Blockchain is one of the new technologies used to transform the face of the sector. In fact, most large-scale insurers have already incorporated these innovative methods into their businesses and made them available to their clients.</p>



<h2>What is Blockchain?</h2>



<p>Blockchain is more than just a digital currency. It is a transformative technology with the potential to revolutionize various <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-will-blockchain-technology-impact-the-retail-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">industries</a>. First, however, we need to understand that blockchain technology and digital currency are two distinct concepts and that the applications of both technologies extend far <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-will-blockchain-technology-impact-the-transportation-industry/" data-wpel-link="internal">beyond</a> financial services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that maintains a continuously growing list of records, called blocks. The blocks are linked by cryptography to ensure that each block contains the correct and immutable data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Insurance sector can leverage blockchain technology to improve market transparency, efficiency, consensus, immutability, and provenance.</p>



<h2>Insurance Sector</h2>



<p>Indian Insurance businesses compete fiercely for the business of both retail and corporate clients, who demand the best value and an exceptional online experience. In addition, consumers continue to purchase new policies over the phone; many policies are still processed using paper contracts, with no digital records of the policies, and the list goes on. Hence, both retail and corporate consumers of insurance firms demand the best value for their money and an exceptional online experience in this highly competitive market.</p>



<p>Although the Indian insurance industry has a well-earned reputation for being slow to adapt and evolve, as technology permeates every part of our lives, it seems that the good old reputation might be up for a change—and blockchain may play a significant role in the future of the industry. As a result, blockchain technology gives India&#8217;s insurance sector a chance for growth and positive transformation.</p>



<h2>How can blockchain change the face of transit systems?</h2>



<p>Blockchain implementation can solve many of the problems associated with insurance policies. These problems include getting customer authorization or approval and working together to utilize funds in shared resources and infrastructures. Through blockchain, accurate, immutable, and real-time records can be kept of every detail pertaining to a policy. This provides each transaction&#8217;s dates, timings, participants, settings, and values. Blockchain is safer than any other technology to date since it distributes consent, protecting this information from any unauthorized or unlawful alterations and manipulation. Here are a few use cases of blockchain integration in the insurance industry:</p>



<h3><strong>Fraud detection &amp; Prevention</strong></h3>



<p>A tamper-proof consumer data repository that can be reliably exchanged between enterprises can be established using blockchain. This system of cooperation will also help reduce the danger of error and the need for duplication of work, saving time and resources. Further, the technology enhances client activity visibility across banks, enhancing regulatory compliance.</p>



<h3><strong>Automation of Claims</strong></h3>



<p>The claims process can be made more efficient through automated procedures that can reduce the time required to manage each claim transaction by up to 90%. This could be achieved through smart contracts that are run on a blockchain infrastructure. Claims processing using blockchain can assist in creating a trustworthy, transparent, and customer-focused business model. A direct link between the claimant, insurer and third parties can be established in place of the traditional time-consuming procedure, allowing all data to be directly submitted and providing an audit trail. It wouldn&#8217;t take much support from outside stakeholders to make the claims procedure insurance company-centric.</p>



<h3><strong>Insurance Distribution &amp; Availability</strong></h3>



<p>Consumers may easily toggle between activating and deactivating their insurance coverage with on-demand insurance. However, the more times all parties involved engage with the policy documents, the more difficult it is to manage the records. Blockchain has the ability to inexpensively coordinate the activity of numerous participants in an online marketplace. Thanks to technology, customers can manage several policies on the same platform and provide direct access to multiple stakeholders. It will facilitate quick, simple, and affordable transactions for paying premiums or claims.</p>



<h3><strong>Data Accessibility and Management</strong></h3>



<p>Data accessibility is crucial since the insurance sector is based on the risk assessment model. However, due to data confidentiality terms, it can be challenging to make claimants&#8217; data accessible to insurance companies. Clearly, such a data flow could influence how health insurance providers decide how much to charge for premiums or what is covered under policies. Due to its cryptographical security, blockchain enables sharing of such private information without jeopardizing patient confidentiality.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>The nation&#8217;s insurance sector has been slow to adopt technology, but it seems that the time is ripe for the new wave of innovation that is blockchain. The critical question that looms, however, remains whether or not all insurers will agree to comply with such a change. Once this hurdle is passed, we will see a substantial impact of blockchain on the insurance sector. There are a host of advantages that blockchain offers to insurers and their clients alike, both in terms of increased accuracy and efficiency as well as improved privacy and security measures. And once a clear regulatory framework has been established so as to ensure compliance, there&#8217;s no telling how much these advantages will benefit the business of insurance companies worldwide.</p>

<p>The world&#8217;s issues are intricate. The most incredible way to solve any problem is to break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces. Let&#8217;s emphasize the manufacturing industry and its complexity for the time being. Let&#8217;s focus on the factory of the future in this article.</p>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-will-blockchain-technology-impact-the-industrial-manufacturing-industry/" data-wpel-link="internal">Manufacturing</a> is accounted for 54% of the world&#8217;s energy usage and 20% of its emissions. Rethinking how production, manufacturing, and distribution are done will reduce 45% of world emissions. Therefore, we see enormous advantages in rethinking how factories and manufacturing operations, particularly in light of the current state of unpredictability and supply chain concerns. It&#8217;s time to establish the Factory of the Future.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s learn about the &#8220;Factory of the Future&#8221; and how Blockchain can influence it.</p>



<h2>Factory of the Future: Definition</h2>



<p>A Factory of the Future is a manufacturing business focused on the future and leverages the most cutting-edge digital technology to develop smart and sustainable operations. It uses creative business strategies and makes the best use of the resources and energy that are readily accessible, that place a strong emphasis on employee empowerment. As a result, its products frequently have a high level of added value and can adapt quickly to changing consumer demands.</p>



<h2>Dimensions of Factory of the Future</h2>



<p>The idea behind the &#8220;factory of the future&#8221; is that producers should boost output by making adjustments in three areas: plant structure, plant digitization, and plant processes.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Plant Structure</strong></li></ul>



<p>The plant structure of the future will be more adaptable, multidirectional, modular, and use environmentally friendly production methods.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Plant Digitization</strong></li></ul>



<p>Manufacturers are rapidly using digital technologies. Companies are encouraging efficiency in a variety of ways by enabling better automation.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Plant Processes</strong></li></ul>



<p>Utilizing new digital technology, manufacturers are improving lean management and achieving its full potential.</p>



<h2>5 Ways Blockchain can help the Factory of the Future create value</h2>



<ol><li><strong>Enhancing the capacity to track and monitor</strong></li></ol>



<p>Businesses can leverage Blockchain to send data more efficiently, accurately, and securely within complex supply chains. For example, it could provide a permanent digital record of the parts, materials, and finished goods, enabling end-to-end visibility and giving everyone access to a single source of truth.</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Safeguarding and monetizing valuable intellectual property</strong></li></ol>



<p>Businesses in the manufacturing sector need IP protection. Along with cost, IP protection is a crucial consideration when selecting whether to make parts internally or purchase them from a supplier. In addition, a company can decide to employ Blockchain technology to demonstrate its IP in the case of a patent dispute.</p>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Ensuring and streamlining quality control</strong></li></ol>



<p>Expanding customer value is another important objective of the Factory of the Future, which might be achieved by using Blockchain to support quality control. Because of the Blockchain, it is now feasible to provide customers with complete transparency and extensive documentation on the quality of processes and items that require expensive support from centralized parties that control IT platforms.</p>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-will-blockchain-technology-impact-the-education-industry/" data-wpel-link="internal">Blockchain</a> offers immutable records of quality assurance procedures and data on the manufacturing process, as well as helping customers monitor and trace incoming goods across a supply chain. The database uniquely marks each product and promptly records every transaction, update, and quality check made on the Blockchain. This application requires the production setup to have automated quality checks that generate and write measurements directly to the Blockchain.</p>



<ol start="4"><li><strong>Enhancing the value of Machines as a Service (MaaS)</strong></li></ol>



<p>Blockchain is making it possible to employ the novel pay-per-use business model for equipment known as Machines as a Service (MaaS). Under this strategy, a machinery provider bills for the use of manufacturing equipment based on the volume of production it produces as opposed to selling it.</p>



<p>Manufacturers could improve their equipment instead of incurring hefty upfront fees. Moreover, if effectively applied, the MaaS idea will enable manufacturers to increase their production flexibility efficiently.</p>



<ol start="5"><li><strong>Allowing the machine to manage maintenance</strong></li></ol>



<p>Blockchain can facilitate new maintenance methods, including automatic service agreements and shorter maintenance periods. To facilitate outsourced maintenance, users upload service agreements and installation documentation related to each piece of equipment to the Blockchain record, generating a digital twin of the machine. Blockchain technology can then automate the execution and payment of scheduled maintenance.</p>



<p>A machine that requires maintenance can generate a service request, a smart contract, and a new part. Payment is automatically handled when the order has been filled. The Blockchain record is also supported by unchangeable evidence of the maintenance history. These, currently in development apps, improve equipment dependability, simplify monitoring of equipment health and attrition, and offer auditable machinery health evaluations.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Due to Blockchain&#8217;s effectiveness in processing transactions, businesses are already looking to technology to address various production-related issues.</p>



<p>The factory of the future will continue to involve a vast network of equipment, components, goods, and value chain partners, such as equipment suppliers and shipping firms. Therefore, the impact of the Blockchain will undoubtedly grow as smart factories link to one another more and more.</p>

<p>Let us explore how blockchains could help reduce these costs for global transit systems in the future.</p>



<h2>What is Blockchain?</h2>



<p>Blockchain, a technological breakthrough and unique decentralized database technology, could help to increase collaboration, the sharing of trusted information and efficiency, and reduce costs and risk while introducing newer business models in the mass transit space for the years to come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>India&#8217;s mass transit sector can leverage blockchain technology to improve market transparency, efficiency, consensus, immutability, and provenance.</p>



<h2>Transportation Sector</h2>



<p>In order to be efficient and sustainable, societies must embrace public transit. Public transportation campaigns to minimize pollution have changed how people view public transport as outdated and overflowing buses. The future of transportation, <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-will-blockchain-technology-impact-the-travel-tourism-industry/" data-wpel-link="internal">tourism</a>, and <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-will-blockchain-technology-impact-the-logistics-industry/" data-wpel-link="internal">logistics </a>is being powered by the blockchain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockchain allows for trustless automated accounting, eliminating risk, as well as increased monitoring of transactions and automatic validation and reconciliation. As a result, both companies and individuals can benefit from blockchain-based systems in various transportation scenarios.</p>



<p>Integrating blockchain technology will aid the mainstreaming of public transit in several ways. As a sample of its possible use cases, it may safeguard rental bike fleets, facilitate ridesharing, and distribute vital information.</p>



<h2>How can blockchain change the face of transit systems?</h2>



<p>Indian transit systems rely on various stakeholders to operate efficiently, including governments and other authorities at both local and national levels; private sector operators; infrastructure owners; service providers (e.g., bus manufacturers); riders; commuters; businesses; and so forth. Each stakeholder has its own interests that affect the transit system&#8217;s success as a whole. Blockchain technology offers new ways to improve collaboration between different actors within transportation systems in order to deliver better outcomes for travelers at a lower cost while reducing environmental impacts and other negative externalities associated with transportation systems. Here are a few use cases of blockchain integration in the transportation industry:</p>



<h3><strong>Fleet Maintenance &amp; Management</strong></h3>



<p>The efficiency of specific fleet vehicles can be tracked using the integration of blockchain. For instance, when a company wants to purchase a used bus, the blockchain can help validate information about the vehicle&#8217;s past performance and maintenance history. A business with a sizable fleet of vehicles can also readily monitor the performance of the vehicles they already own.</p>



<h3><strong>Payment &amp; Ticketing</strong></h3>



<p>Blockchain eases the process of ticketing and payments by utilizing crypto and smart contracts in the system. Particularly for multimodal trips involving multiple modes of transportation, the procedure of purchasing and using tickets can be incredibly fragmented, time-consuming, and highly frustrating. Commuters may now purchase transport tickets from their starting point to their destination in a much more straightforward and efficient way, thanks to the use of blockchain technologies.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>P2P Network Tracking</strong></h3>



<p>The rise of P2P networks is being facilitated by blockchain because it makes it simple for participants to view and share pertinent records. For example, blockchain technology could make it possible to track nearby public vehicles, access insurance plans, and manage settings on the vehicle by logging sensor data. These functions would be extremely advantageous in ridesharing scenarios. Moreover, while using public transport like buses or trains, a passenger can know where a bus or train is; and a driver can know whether to stop at a particular stop or not (whether there are any passengers or not), saving time and fuel.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Mobility as a Service</strong></h3>



<p>The landscape is changing significantly in the Indian transportation sector due to the influence of connected vehicles, autonomous vehicles, and ridesharing. As a result, industry leaders are continually looking for ways to boost productivity, enhance security, lessen their impact on the environment, and improve the customer experience in order to remain competitive. Fortunately, blockchain has the ability to address some of the most critical issues facing the industry. The business models, when used to resolve the problems in the industry, ensuring mobility for all are known as implementing mobility as a service (MaaS). Mobility businesses are already integrating blockchain and developing innovative applications to confirm a vehicle&#8217;s history, improve supply chain tracking, automate transactions, enable smooth ridesharing, or support more equitable insurance.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>The blockchain is a game-changer in the world of finance, business, and technology and could have impacts just as significant when applied to mass transit. The infrastructure may be different, but the general principles behind a secure, distributed ledger could provide a common platform to improve information sharing and collaboration. As the companies, government agencies, and individuals involved in transit systems begin to test the waters of blockchain implementation; there will be no going back. It will be interesting to see how blockchain evolves as it becomes more widely accepted and implemented.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s critical to comprehend and learn about the bullish and bearish market patterns, to be able to make wiser investment decisions throughout your crypto journey. This is due to the possibility of various market trends that can result in significantly different market conditions. In this blog post, learn about four crucial pieces of investing advice for the Crypto bear market.</p>



<p>Before we look at the investing tips, let&#8217;s take a step back and evaluate the scenario of the Crypto bear market of 2022.</p>



<h2>Scenario of Crypto bear market</h2>



<p>The current condition of the crypto market has sparked much discussion and differing viewpoints. Since the start of 2022, the phrases &#8220;volatile market&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/6-crypto-bear-market-mistakes-to-avoid-in-2022/" data-wpel-link="internal">crypto bear market</a>&#8221; have been most frequently used concerning the crypto industry. When seen in the context of investing as a whole, the crypto space is not different from other conventional assets. However, crypto markets often see higher volatility during a bear market.</p>



<p>Every investor must examine the market and its historical behavior as the crypto market is transitioning through a &#8220;crypto winter&#8221; period. However, during such market cycles, investors should plan, optimize their strategies with careful study, and take advantage of such chances rather than responding out of FOMO.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s start our journey to learning about strategizing for better investing in the bear market.</p>



<h2>Investing tips during the Bear Market</h2>



<h3>#1 Shorting</h3>



<p>Short selling or &#8221; shorting&#8221; are terms used when traders believe a market will drop. If their forecast is accurate, they gain from it. This strategy works in various other markets, not necessarily only in the crypto market.</p>



<p>Shorting can be a very profitable strategy and is possible through CFDs (Contracts for Difference), derivatives, and crypto margin exchanges. By using them, traders can sell assets they don&#8217;t even own. In short, a short trade is the sale of borrowed assets at market value.</p>



<h3>#2 HODLing</h3>



<p>The next strategy is HODLing. Interestingly, &#8220;HODL&#8221; also evolved into the abbreviation &#8220;Hold On for Dear Life,&#8221; which refers to investors not selling their coins even if the market experiences severe declines.</p>



<p>In its simplest form, the word refers to a waiting-based trading strategy. It is a long-term approach and many investors&#8217; fundamental principles. The HODLers think the secret is to hold onto their money and withstand pressure. Someday, when the market settles, and crypto is widely used, it is expected that they will be rewarded for their confidence in their coins.</p>



<p>It is accurate to say that future predictions are impossible. However, some investors believe HODLing is the best option; crypto will eventually replace traditional stock markets and fundamentally alter society.</p>



<h3>#3 Buy low, sell high</h3>



<p>Naturally, the goal of every investor is to achieve a profit. Therefore, many of them choose to withdraw when the value of crypto declines. Only a selected few people, even at cheap costs, are ready to take a chance and keep purchasing. The majority of people tend to purchase near the peak and sell near the bottom.</p>



<p>Some investors tend to sell their coins in a panic that they have bought around the top of the market; others seek to average down the price and have bought during 2018 when the market experienced the bloodbath. This is obvious that investors should always conduct thorough research before purchasing any coins.</p>



<h3>#4 Don&#8217;t be dependent on a single coin.</h3>



<p>The final advice for budding investors is to remember that diversification is the best course of action. Crypto future predictions are unrealistic, and every investment carries <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/6-ways-to-minimize-risks-when-investing-in-crypto/" data-wpel-link="internal">risk</a>. However, diversifying your investments enhances the likelihood that you&#8217;ll make the best decision.</p>



<h2>Concluding words</h2>



<p>Nobody wants to see their investments incur losses. However, you must thoroughly understand a bear market or price fall in your mind before choosing any asset class. What rises will come down, which investors need to keep in mind. As a result, only invest the fund you can afford to lose. Use the strategies mentioned above so you don&#8217;t panic when such circumstances arise and not panic if such a situation occurs.</p>



<p>And finally, always DYOR!</p>

<p>DENT is a cryptocurrency with one very clear goal: to reduce the cost of roaming mobile phone calls and data consumption. Tero Katajainen, the company&#8217;s CEO and founder, created it, and it was introduced in 2017 as a means of payment for DENT Wireless.</p>



<h2>What is the Dent (DENT)?</h2>



<p>DENT stands for a tokenized mobile-data market that has been freed from the tightly controlled, monopolized telecoms sector. DENT is a game-changing technology that, at its heart, uses the Ethereum blockchain to enable a data-sharing economy &#8220;where users are able to freely purchase, sell, and donate their mobile data, from any user to any user.&#8221;</p>



<p>The UK&#8217;s decision by the majority of mobile providers to impose European roaming fees due to the country&#8217;s overwhelming vote to leave the European Union (EU) on January 31, 2020, or &#8220;Brexit,&#8221; has brought data roaming into the sharp spotlight. However, despite leaving Continental Europe to take advantage of its permissive cross-border internet usage, travelers on a larger scale are still burdened by exorbitant roaming fees and slow network speeds because data must be routed through their home country. DENT can help in this situation. In an effort to permanently fix this issue, the project was started. The <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/DENT-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">DENT token</a>, a cryptocurrency based on the ERC-20 standard that conducted an initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017, serves as the foundation for this technology.</p>



<p>DENT does not intend to take the place of the current service providers. Instead, the decentralized DENT network will serve as a companion, allowing travelers to smoothly swap between it and their usual telecoms provider as needed.</p>



<p>The Ethereum-based token that drives the DENT infrastructure is the <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/DENT-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">DENT coin</a>. In July 2017, DENT completed an initial coin offering (ICO), raising $4.3m off of 70 billion offered tokens, valued at $0.00006 at the time. As part of its &#8220;Gigabytes for Africa&#8221; program, DENT has committed one billion DENT tokens to advance the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDG) in underdeveloped nations.</p>



<h2>How to Buy DENT Tokens in India?</h2>



<p>By following a few simple steps, you can <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/DENT-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">buy DENT tokens in India</a> via WazirX, India&#8217;s most trusted and widely used cryptocurrency exchange.</p>



<p>Now, you can buy DENT tokens using P2P trade. <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/wazirx-p2p-all-your-questions-answered/" data-wpel-link="internal">Here are all your questions answered about P2P.&nbsp;</a></p>



<p><strong>Step 1 &#8211; Sign-Up on WazirX</strong></p>



<p>To start trading the DENT token, you should first create your account by signing up on the WazirX platform. Or you can directly Log-in if you already have an account with WazirX.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a guide explaining <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-to-open-an-account-on-wazirx/" data-wpel-link="internal">how to open an account on WazirX.</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="152" src="https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-14.png" alt="" class="wp-image-24590" srcset="https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-14.png 300w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-14-228x116.png 228w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Step 2- Verify your email account and set up your account security</strong>.</p>



<p>The following step is to verify your email address. After signing up, you&#8217;ll receive a verification link on your email address by which you&#8217;ve just created your account.</p>



<p>On clicking on the link, you&#8217;ll have two options to assure the security of your account &#8211; the authenticator app and mobile SMS (as shown in the image below)</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> The authenticator app is a more secure way to stay safe when compared to mobile SMS because there&#8217;s a risk of delayed reception or SIM card hacking.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="279" src="https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-13.png" alt="" class="wp-image-24589" srcset="https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-13.png 300w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-13-125x116.png 125w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Step 3 &#8211; Complete the KYC</strong>.</p>



<p>After selecting the appropriate country, <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-to-complete-kyc-verification-on-wazirx/" data-wpel-link="internal">complete the KYC process.</a></p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> Without completing your KYC, you will be unable to trade P2P or withdraw funds on the WazirX app.</p>



<p><strong>Step 4 &#8211; Add funds to your WazirX account through P2P</strong>.</p>



<p>After linking your bank account to your WazirX account, you can buy USDT through P2P to the WazirX wallet. The USDT will work as funds to buy other coins.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Step 5 &#8211; Buy DENT on WazirX</strong></p>



<p>You can purchase DENT tokens using P2P trade through WazirX. Check the DENT to INR rate from <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/MATIC-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">here</a> and DENT to USDT <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/MATIC-USDT" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After logging in to your WazirX account, you can select USDT from the &#8220;Exchange&#8221; tab. You can see all the price charts, order book data, and an order input form on the right side of the screen.</p>



<p>Click &#8220;Buy&#8221; after entering the amount and checking the total USDT amount to be paid.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your order will be placed according to the price you have input. A seller willing to sell at a price will be notified, and then you can exchange the tokens using P2P.</p>



<p>It might take a few minutes for the order to be completed, but as soon as it is executed, you will receive the DENT coins you purchased in your WazirX wallet.</p>



<p>Happy Trading!</p>

<p>Dear Tribe,</p>



<p>We at WazirX are constantly working on enhancing our systems to ensure that your experience and crypto journey is easy and quick. For example, we recently modified our ‘P2P Dispute Resolution’ process. You can read more about it <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/p2p-dispute-resolution-now-easier/" data-wpel-link="internal">here</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Did you Know?</p><p>50% of disputes would not arise if we, as buyers, uploaded the right payment proofs.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>



<p>In this article, we will list all the pointers a buyer must keep in mind while uploading payment proof on the WazirX P2P engine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you are aware, you can pay for your P2P buy orders via UPI/IMPS/Bank transfer. Apps like PayTM, Google Pay, PhonePe, BHIM, etc., support UPI transactions. To add, some of them also let you send money directly to bank accounts (using a bank account number). Alternatively, you can use your banking app or net banking solution to make account payments. Now, when you place a buy order on WazirX P2P and pay for it, you will have to confirm that you have made the payment on the app (web and mobile).&nbsp;</p>



<p>At this step, you as a buyer are also expected to upload the payment proof. This could be either a screenshot of the transaction on your payment app or your bank statement. Whether its a screenshot or a bank statement, the following details should be clearly visible:</p>



<ul><li>Amount paid.</li><li>Transaction ID. </li></ul>



<p>Here are a few samples of the payment proofs acceptable on WazirX:</p>

<p>Namaste Tribe! Here’s a monthly report of what happened at WazirX in July.</p>



<h2>What happened last month?</h2>



<p><strong>[Done] 1 new market pair</strong>: We <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/coins-listed-july-wazirx/" data-wpel-link="internal">added</a> 1 token to our USDT market last month! You can now buy, sell, and trade OP on WazirX. Start trading your favorite pairs <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">here</a>!</p>



<h2>What are we building?</h2>



<p><strong>[Ongoing] AMM Protocol:</strong> There have been unforeseen delays in some of the protocols that our DEX is dependent upon. This is preventing us from going live. At this moment, we don’t have an ETA on how long this will take. Be assured that we’re working very hard with the protocol team to expedite the process.</p>



<p><strong>[Ongoing] New tokens</strong>: We’ll be listing more tokens on WazirX in the coming weeks. Got any suggestions? Please tweet to us @WazirXIndia.</p>



<h2>Some highlights</h2>



<ul><li>To make the dispute resolution on our P2P engine effortless, we have introduced the <strong>Payment Proof Collection </strong>feature. This will streamline the process of collecting proofs from buyers and sellers in case of disputes. You can read more about this feature <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/p2p-dispute-resolution-now-easier/" data-wpel-link="internal">here</a>.</li><li>At WazirX, we periodically review each digital asset we list to ensure that it continues to meet the high level of standard we expect. When a coin or token no longer meets this standard or the industry changes, we conduct a more in-depth review and potentially delist it. On 8 July 2022, we <strong>delisted Groestlcoin (GRS/USDT) and Nebulas (NAS/USDT, and NAS/INR)</strong>. You can read about this <a href="https://support.wazirx.com/hc/en-us/articles/4735949007130-WazirX-Will-Delist-GRS-and-NAS-on-8th-July-2022" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li></ul>



<p>It has been an exciting month for us as we are working on something big and exciting. We are looking forward to August 2022 with lots of hope and positivity. Do keep supporting us like you always do.&nbsp;</p>

But if you are unsure whether Neo has enough potential to fetch you gains, this article will help you resolve your dilemma. In this article, you will learn all about Neo cryptocurrency and why you should invest in it. Also, you&#8217;ll get an understanding of where to buy Neo cryptocurrency and how to <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/NEO-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">buy Neo cryptocurrency in India</a> for you to make a well-informed decision.</p>



<h2>What is Neo blockchain?</h2>



<p>Neo, initially called Antshares, was co-founded by Da Hongfei and Erik Zhan in China in 2014. It was later rebranded to Neo in June 2017. Neo blockchain is often referred to as the &#8220;Ethereum of China&#8221; due to its Chinese origin. It brands itself as a platform via which anyone can transact and build decentralized products and services, similar to Ethereum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It works on the <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/33598/delegated-byzantine-fault-tolerance-dbft" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT)</a> – a modified <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp#:~:text=of%2DStake%20FAQs-,What%20Is%20Proof%2Dof%2DStake%20(PoS)%3F,and%20keeping%20the%20database%20secure." data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Proof-of-Stake (PoS)</a> protocol. The Neo blockchain aims to automate the management of digital assets via <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">smart contracts</a> and build a distributed network-based smart economy system. Unlike many other blockchains, this network has dual native tokens: NEO and GAS. While NEO functions as an investment token, GAS is utilized to pay transaction fees on the network.</p>



<p>The Neo blockchain provides easier digitalization of assets in an open, decentralized, traceable, and transparent manner without intermediaries and associated costs. With Neo, users can link their physical assets with a digital avatar which comes with an added advantage of Neo blockchain&#8217;s protection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Why buy NEO Token?</h2>



<p>The NEO coin is the native token of the large ecosystem of smart contracts, distributed apps, and other functionalities hosted over the Neo blockchain. Currently, there are 70.5 million NEO tokens in circulation — and a total supply of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEO_(cryptocurrency)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">100 million</a> was generated when the blockchain was launched. These tokens were distributed on a 50/50 basis — 50% of the NEO tokens were sold in the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/initial-coin-offering-ico.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">ICO,</a> and the other half was split among developers and the Neo Council. </p>



<p>The Neo network can be used to launch any cryptocurrency using the <a href="https://docs.neo.org/v2/tutorials/en-us/9-smartContract/What_is_nep5.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">NEP-5</a> standard. One of the main qualities that give Neo an edge over other coins is its platform’s consistent and endless developments, which ensure that NEO cryptocurrency is future-proof and scalable.</p>



<p>The features that make the Neo crypto platform stand apart from the others include multi-language support, native oracles, advanced interoperability, decentralized storage, self-sovereign identity, best-in-class tooling, and a dual-token model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, Neo blockchain supports common programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, etc., and has attracted a large number of developers. This can be a game-changer for Neo as it can easily bring a larger community of developers to contribute to its platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On 2 August 2021, the Neo network announced the launch of its latest and one of the biggest developments, Neo 3.0 or the N3 version, which will enhance network security and allow more transactions to be processed per second.  N3 is expected to upscale the transaction speed from 1000 TPS to 5000 TPS while <a href="https://neo.org/blog/details/4247" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">reducing the gas fees </a>by 100 times. </p>

<p>Today, most investors use Decentralized Exchanges (DEX), and everyone is well aware of the increasing price of the transactions on Ethereum&#8217;s blockchain.</p>



<p>Decentralized Exchanges coordinate directly with the blockchain&#8217;s network, and there&#8217;s no third party that holds your funds. Having custody of your digital assets gives a level of protection centralized exchanges cannot offer their investors.</p>



<p>Loopring (LRC) has created a protocol on Ethereum&#8217;s network to address its scalability issues on Ethereum&#8217;s blockchain. As a result, loopring crypto users can benefit from the added security provided by a DEX while paying significantly less on transacting on Ethereum.</p>



<p>In this article, let&#8217;s learn about what is Loopring crypto, Loopring crypto price predictions, and how to buy Loopring coin in India, along with understanding whether it is a good investment.</p>



<h2>What is Loopring (LRC) Crypto?</h2>



<p>Loopring (LRC) is an ERC-20 token and primary crypto for the Loopring blockchain network. On the other hand, it is an open-source blockchain protocol created to support Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs). It is an Ethereum mainnet-hosted layer 2 scaling solution.</p>



<p>Loopring differentiates itself from other Ethereum-based Layer-2 solutions in several ways.</p>



<p>Firstly, Loopring was the first zkRollup L2 to debut on the Ethereum platform. Secondly, it was explicitly created to support the development and deployment of decentralized exchanges, while the other Layer 2s, like Polygon, is generalized to support various niches.</p>



<p>As the Loopring was designed to aid faster deployment and more secured DEXs, all this is accomplished by ensuring the integrity and security of the DEXs installed on the platform. Additionally, it ensures that the platform&#8217;s exchanges are lightning-fast and that trading fees are 100X less than the gas fees on the ETH mainnet.</p>



<h2>How Does a Loopring Work?</h2>



<p>Loopring&#8217;s main point of differentiation is the advanced cryptography that it integrates on its platform. However, it&#8217;s vital to keep in mind that zkRollups are just one potential method of enhancing the Ethereum blockchain&#8217;s suitability for DeFi applications.</p>



<p>Some supporters believe that zkRollups are promising because they make use of a well-known approach of cryptography called zero-knowledge proofs, which enables the computer program to claim something about data without actually disclosing the data.</p>



<p>zkRollups combine several transfers into a single transaction, enabling quick and inexpensive trades to take place outside the Ethereum blockchain at first. Then, these transactions are resolved on the blockchain, where the accuracy of off-chain transactions is verified using zero-knowledge proofs.</p>



<p><strong>zkRollups on Loopring</strong></p>



<p>To begin transacting on a Loopring exchange, users should first transfer their funds to a smart contract that is run by the Loopring protocol.</p>



<p>Then, the Loopring exchanges shift the computation required to complete the deals of the primary Ethereum blockchain. This information includes things like order history and account balances for specific users.</p>



<p>Loopring resolves transactions on the Ethereum blockchain to complete deals between initially matched off-chain users. To minimize costs and speed up transactions, these deals are batch-processed. With this approach, Loopring claims to be able to execute over 2,000 trades per second.</p>



<p>Every batch of transactions is subsequently added to the Ethereum blockchain that includes zero-knowledge proofs that make it possible for anybody to reverse-engineer the off-chain transactions.</p>



<p>This makes users gain confidence that the transactions are real and that no unauthorized parties can tamper with them.</p>



<p>This is how Loopring works. Now let&#8217;s check the step-by-step process to buy the Loopring crypto.</p>



<h2>How to Buy Loopring (LRC) Coin in India?</h2>



<p>The following steps can help you <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/LRC-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">buy LRC tokens in India</a> via WazirX, India&#8217;s most trusted and widely used cryptocurrency exchange.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-4.png" alt="Buy LRC on WazirX" class="wp-image-24507" width="303" height="374" srcset="https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-4.png 416w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-4-243x300.png 243w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-4-94x116.png 94w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px" /></figure>



<p>It might take some time for the order to be completed, but as soon as it is done, you will receive the LRC coins you purchased in your WazirX wallet.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s now check whether Loopring is a good investment or not.</p>



<h2>Is Loopring a Good Investment?</h2>



<p>There is fierce competition for Loopring from a few different blockchain technologies with similar objectives. They are similar projects with 9-figure market capitalizations. But the prominent Ethereum&#8217;s issue that Loopring solves is that of scalability. Its innovative method of scaling transactions helps users to trade on DEXs at a fraction of the cost and time it would take on Ethereum&#8217;s blockchain.</p>



<p>Every crypto investment is risky, including the Loopring crypto. <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/LRC-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">LRC</a> is one of those crypto projects with strong backing and has stood in the market for quite some time. Always do your research before investing.</p>

<p>The Basic Attention Token (BAT) is basically a blockchain-based protocol that traces media consumers&#8217; time and attention on websites using its web browser, Brave. It is built on Ethereum, where its goal is to proficiently share the advertising money among the advertisers, publishers, and readers of online marketing content and advertisements. The sole purpose of BAT is to let readers experience lesser ads tailored to their likes and interests, along with ensuring that their data privacy is not breached.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s start with the basic introduction of the Basic Attention Token (BAT) coin and a step-by-step process for buying BAT tokens in India.</p>



<p>To check the <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/BAT-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">BAT cryptocurrency price in India</a>, click <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/BAT-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>



<h2><a></a>Basic Attention Token (BAT): A Brief Introduction</h2>



<p>The Basic Attention Asset (BAT) is a blockchain-based token that tracks consumer attention and time spent on website media content using the Brave browser. Most cryptocurrencies are concentrated on the blockchain, DeFi (Decentralized Finance), data storage, management, and transaction. Still, there aren&#8217;t many market participants that pay attention to effective online marketing and digital advertising.</p>



<p>The Brave Browser uses the BAT coin, a unique currency, to power a blockchain-enabled digital advertising ecosystem that allows users to see advertisements while maintaining their privacy and earning BAT rewards. This enables fair incentives to consumers for their attention, along with providing advertisers to obtain a higher return on their investment, with the added advantages of tailored advertising for maximum engagement and fewer losses due to fraud.</p>



<p>In the Brave ecosystem, the <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/BAT-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">BAT coin</a> serves as a reward unit that is distributed between users, marketers, artists, and publishers. Advertisers can fund their advertising efforts with BAT tokens as a kind of payment, in which around 70% of these tokens are then given back to users.</p>



<h2><a></a>How Does BAT Work?</h2>



<p>All the BAT transactions that take place get settled on Ethereum, a public blockchain that enables developers to build and deploy unique cryptocurrencies and apps.</p>



<p><strong>Brave Browser</strong></p>



<p>The Brave web browser, created by the team behind the token, is used by BAT. Brave is a liberated browser that promises to load web pages three to six times quicker than competitors&#8217; products because it only displays ads to users who have chosen to watch them.</p>



<p>Users of the Brave browser can enroll in the Brave Rewards program, which enables them to contribute BAT to content providers whose work they wish to support or to get payment in BAT in exchange for seeing advertisements.</p>



<p>In the Brave browser, the trackers and advertisements are blocked by default. Ads are only activated if the user agrees to them. After that, users that see native advertisements from reliable partners are rewarded with BAT by Brave.</p>



<p><strong>Micropayments Ledger by Brave</strong></p>



<p>Brave micropayments ledger is all about keeping track of the movement of BAT.</p>



<p>The Brave Micropayments Ledger is designed to enable smart contracts between marketers, publishers, and readers to transfer payments.</p>



<p>For its blockchain, Brave is looking at using zero-knowledge proofs to provide anonymity to stakeholders in online media transactions.</p>



<h2><a></a>How to Buy BAT Tokens in India?</h2>



<p>By following a few simple steps, you can buy BAT tokens in India via WazirX, India&#8217;s most trusted and widely used <a href="https://wazirx.com/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">cryptocurrency exchange</a>.</p>

<p>Property ownership has traditionally been governed by a set of written rules and guidelines that the legislature decides. The traditional system is notorious for its red-tapism, which leads to inefficiency, risk, and corruption. However, the old world is giving way to the new, digital one; therefore, things are different now.</p>



<p>Thanks to blockchain, the Indian real estate sector is being reimagined. With its disruptive nature and a wide array of benefits, it&#8217;s no surprise that many are adopting the technology. From property title verification to creating a digital public ledger, developers have been shifting away from the traditional world order to build more sustainable and fair systems.</p>



<p>We have curated a list of industries that can benefit from Blockchain technology. You can check all the blogs here:</p>

<h2>What is Blockchain?</h2>



<p>Blockchain, otherwise known as an immutable record of digital transactions, is the buzzword in finance these days. It has been termed as the &#8220;next big thing&#8221; – disruptive technology steadily making its way into industries that have been most resistant to disruption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The real estate sector can leverage blockchain technology to improve market transparency and efficiency, resulting in greater profitability for both investors and brokers. </p>



<p>Various industries are being disrupted by the integration of blockchain. Read about how the healthcare sector is being transformed by blockchain.</p>



<h2>Real Estate Sector</h2>



<p>The commercial real estate industry is one of the world&#8217;s largest and most significant markets. It comprises a substantial portion of world economic assets and transaction activity. In India, the commercial real estate sector is slowly adopting the usage of blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Experts in the real estate sector have realized that blockchain-based smart contracts can contribute significantly more to their industry. Blockchain technology has the ability to change fundamental real estate processes, such as property transactions, including the purchase, sale, financing, leasing, and maintenance of properties.</p>



<h2>How can blockchain help the current Real Estate sector?</h2>



<p>Given the disruption of financial services by blockchain technology and the following widespread adoption across industries, it is challenging to pinpoint a sector that has not been impacted. Blockchain is used in various industries, including payments, stocks, venture capital businesses, and the food supply industry. It has an impact on the real estate industry as well. Here are a few use cases of blockchain integration in Real Estate:</p>



<h3><strong>Smart Contracts</strong></h3>



<p>Through the creation of smart contracts, which don&#8217;t need external assistance, the blockchain provides unrivaled efficiency. These digitalized contracts are comparable to paper contracts in some respects, but they give the parties the ability to safeguard all the information contained and prevent its change. This will reduce the paperwork and the bureaucratic intervention.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Automated Transactions</strong></h3>



<p>Blockchain can enable smart contracts that automatically handle bills and payments, reducing processing times, ensuring correctness, and preserving and sharing digital data. It will help in reducing and tackling property ownership disputes. Furthermore, this will allow Banking companies to process the Loans faster and according to the prescribed guidelines. Future real estate transactions, like purchasing new houses using cryptocurrency, may be made easier thanks to this cutting-edge digital technology.</p>



<h3><strong>Fractional Ownership</strong></h3>



<p>Tokenization in real estate involves the digitization of financial instruments, alternative assets, and securities. Tokenization lowers the expenses and accelerates the process of developing new features, issuing and exchanging assets, paying dividends, and managing other company activities. Retail investors may also be able to buy portions of their ideal residences, thanks to tokenization.</p>



<h3><strong>Liquidity</strong></h3>



<p>Due to the lengthy sales pipeline, real estate has traditionally been considered illiquid. This isn&#8217;t true for cryptocurrencies and tokens because, in theory, they can be easily exchanged for fiat money on exchanges. On the other hand, real estate can be easily sold as tokens after blockchain integration. A buyer who can afford the entire purchase is unnecessary for a seller to realize some value from their property.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>On the whole, blockchain is a technology with huge potential to revolutionize real estate. However, to do so, it will need to overcome some key challenges, such as standardization and scalability. Nevertheless, the promise of blockchain technology is clear:</p>



<ul><li>Lowering transaction costs.</li><li>Increasing the speed of business processes.</li><li>Reducing fraud and corruption.</li><li>Providing greater liquidity in a market that has historically suffered from a lack of access to investment.</li></ul>



<p>There is a long way to go to establish blockchain standards and protocols for India&#8217;s real estate industry—and it&#8217;s likely that we will see significant contentions on what these should be in the coming years. But there is no doubt that this technology will change all aspects of the property sector, from buying to selling and from leasing to investment.</p>

<p>Manufacturers and producers are working on Blockchain solutions that might improve operational efficiency, give them more insight into their supply chains, and enable them to track assets with unprecedented accuracy. As a result, Blockchain can completely change how manufacturers plan, engineer, produce and scale their products. It&#8217;s also changing how businesses in India engage because of its ability to promote trust among competitors who must collaborate inside shared ecosystems.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s begin our party with a short introduction to Blockchain technology.</p>



<h2>What is Blockchain?</h2>



<p>As the name shows, a Blockchain is a chain of blocks. However, instead of a physical chain, the block is digital data that is kept in a public database (the chain). A fresh block is adjoined to the Blockchain whenever it incorporates new data.</p>



<p>Blockchain-based solutions can easily combine all the data to benefit <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-will-blockchain-technology-impact-the-travel-tourism-industry/" data-wpel-link="internal">industrial businesses</a> and assist other cutting-edge technologies to reach their full potential, such as Augmented Reality (AR), the Internet of Things (IoT), and 3D printing.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s now get into what Blockchain has to offer to the industrial manufacturing industry.</p>



<h2>Blockchain in industrial manufacturing</h2>



<p>Blockchain has a significant amount of potential in the industrial manufacturing industry. Blockchain can enable a whole new manufacturing business model for the Indian market by enhancing visibility across all process elements, from vendors, strategic sourcing, procurement, and supplier evaluation to shop floor operations, which include machine-level monitoring and servicing. All industrial organizations are built on supply chains, and most can benefit from Blockchain&#8217;s distributed ledger structure and block-based method of aggregating value-exchange transactions to increase efficiency.</p>



<p>Manufacturers can meet delivery dates better, improve product quality, and ultimately sell more products by expanding supplier order accuracy, quality of products, and track-and-traceability.</p>



<h2>Impact of Blockchain on the industrial manufacturing industry</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Blockchain for lot tracking</strong></li></ul>



<p>For manufacturers, supply chain transparency is essential. Food producers are obligated to follow the &#8220;one up, one back&#8221; principle, tracking the origin and destination of the food. Additionally, automakers must follow their suppliers all the way to the final consumer.</p>



<p>Because Blockchain technology provides each component with a unique identification, producers can quickly spot problems and determine what caused them. Blockchain, for instance, can track shipping details, storage temperatures, and expiration dates in the food business. The food company could withdraw the contaminated food from the one lorry where the refrigeration unit malfunctioned rather than having to recall all of its products. Before the product reaches customers, it could be easily recalled.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Blockchain for preventive maintenance</strong></li></ul>



<p>Manufacturers today who care about optimizing uptime are implementing Internet of Things (IoT) and business analytics solutions to find maintenance issues before equipment goes down. Blockchain will effectively deliver the appropriate components and people to the correct location at the right time by adding an additional degree of responsibility and visibility. Furthermore, once the maintenance work order has been issued securely to several service providers, the best service provider is chosen automatically based on location, skill level, and availability.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Blockchain for product lifecycle management</strong></li></ul>



<p>Manufacturers frequently lose track of where their products are being used by end users when they sell their goods through integrators or distributors. Blockchain technology holds forth the prospect of better product lifecycle management by allowing Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to notify end users about the product expiry dates and extend service agreements.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Blockchain for regulatory compliance</strong></li></ul>



<p>Hazardous chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food producers, and other industries with a highly-regulated manufacturing environment can get real-time visibility.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Blockchain to defend against counterfeit goods</strong></li></ul>



<p>Blockchain is being heavily used to verify the integrity of products. Each product can be authenticated at every stage of production and sale by being registered on the Blockchain registry with a distinct ID and essential characteristics. This will help the firm recoup lost income and maintain its reputation.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Blockchain for supply chain finance</strong></li></ul>



<p>Blockchain technology could be employed to control the movement of items and the associated payments. It expedites transactions by eliminating the need for brokers and banks.</p>



<h2>Bottom line: What does the future hold?</h2>



<p>Manufacturing has long been seen as a tradition-bound sector of the Indian economy. However, the Factory of the Future is expected to look substantially different due to technologies like Blockchain, AI, and <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/metaverse-vs-virtual-reality/" data-wpel-link="internal">Machine Learning</a> (ML) playing a more significant role. As blockchain technology develops, it will help manufacturers overcome barriers that have prevented the widespread adoption of other cutting-edge technologies and creative business models.</p>



<p>Consequently, more effective manufacturing operations will be developed and adopted as the new standard in the sector. These operations demand data exchange and teamwork across intricate networks of businesses and machinery.</p>

<p>The layer-2 scaling solution Polygon, formerly known as MATIC network, was developed in 2019 to overcome a number of Ethereum blockchain restrictions, including transaction speed, throughput, and gas costs. It was initially intended to be a scaling solution, but it quickly became a multifunctional ecosystem that has drawn much interest. In the midst of the Initial Exchange Offerings (IEO) boom in 2019, MATIC, its native token, made its Binance Launchpad debut.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s start with the basic introduction of the <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/MATIC-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Polygon Network Coin</a> (MATIC) coin and a step-by-step process for buying MATIC tokens in India.</p>



<h2><a></a>Polygon Network (MATIC)</h2>



<p>Polygon uses a proof-of-stake consensus process, which means that one way you may make money on MATIC you own is by staking. This mechanism is used to create new MATIC and protect the network.</p>



<p>The heavy work is done by validators, who check new transactions before adding them to the blockchain. In return, they might get a portion of the fees and the newly developed MATIC. Running a full-time node (or computer) and staking your own MATIC are requirements for being a validator. You can lose some of your staked MATIC if you commit a mistake or act deliberately (or even if your internet connection is unreliable).</p>



<p>Delegators use a dependable validator to stake their MATIC indirectly. Staking has never been this low commitment. However, research is still necessary since if the validator you choose engages in harmful behavior or commits errors, you could lose some or all of your staked MATIC.</p>



<h2><a></a>How to Buy MATIC Tokens in India?</h2>



<p>By following a few simple steps, you can <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/MATIC-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">buy MATIC tokens in India</a> via WazirX, India&#8217;s most trusted and widely used cryptocurrency exchange.</p>



<p>Now, you can buy MATIC tokens using P2P trade. <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/wazirx-p2p-all-your-questions-answered/" data-wpel-link="internal">Here are all your questions answered about P2P.</a></p>



<p><strong>Step 1 &#8211; Sign-Up on WazirX</strong></p>



<p>To start trading the MATIC token, you should first create your account by signing up on the WazirX platform. Or you can directly Log-in if you already have an account with WazirX.</p>



<p>Here’s a guide explaining <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-to-open-an-account-on-wazirx/" data-wpel-link="internal">how to open an account on WazirX.</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="244" height="123" src="https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-11.png" alt="Sign-Up on WazirX" class="wp-image-24520" srcset="https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-11.png 244w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-11-228x116.png 228w" sizes="(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Step 2- Verify your email account and set up your account security</strong>.</p>



<p>The following step is to verify your email address. After signing up, you&#8217;ll receive a verification link on your email address by which you&#8217;ve just created your account.</p>



<p>On clicking on the link, you&#8217;ll have two options to assure the security of your account &#8211; the authenticator app and mobile SMS (as shown in the image below)</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> The authenticator app is a more secure way to stay safe when compared to mobile SMS because there&#8217;s a risk of delayed reception or SIM card hacking.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="240" height="223" src="https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-10.png" alt="Signup on WazirX" class="wp-image-24519" srcset="https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-10.png 240w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/image-10-125x116.png 125w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></figure>

<p>In this article, let&#8217;s delve into how Blockchain technology will impact India&#8217;s travel and tourism <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-will-blockchain-technology-impact-the-retail-industry/" data-wpel-link="internal">industry</a>.</p>



<p>Before we move forward, let&#8217;s quickly look at Blockchain technology.</p>



<h2>Understanding Blockchain Technology</h2>



<p>Blockchain is a technology that enables the open storage of every transaction that a given network generates. The term &#8220;Blockchain&#8221; refers to a chain of blocks made up of the encrypted copies of each register.</p>



<p>The main feature of Blockchain technology is decentralized data, which means that data is spread across the many nodes or computers that make up the network. Each of the nodes has a copy of the whole range of information gathered. Each member of the Blockchain must agree to the addition of a block or register before it can be included in the copy that each component of the Blockchain keeps. The process ensures that the data on the Blockchain is safe, traceable, immutable, and transparent.</p>



<p>We know Blockchain is having a tremendous impact on every sector and transforming it. So let&#8217;s have a look at how the travel and tourism industry can be transformed and what are some benefits it gains from Blockchain technology.</p>



<h2>How can Blockchain benefit the travel and tourism industry?</h2>



<p>Stability and security are two of the benefits that Blockchain technology potentially provides the tourism sector. Since the Blockchain is decentralized, information can never be accidentally deleted or destroyed as a result of a malicious cyberattack, guaranteeing that transactions are always traceable.</p>



<p>In India, the travel industry depends on several businesses sharing information with one another. For instance, travel agencies have to provide client information to hotels and airlines, and customers&#8217; personal belongings are frequently transmitted between businesses and tracked. Because the responsibility for preserving data is shared throughout the whole network, Blockchain can make accessing and storing essential information simpler and more dependable.</p>



<p>When we talk about India, it is evident that our population and economy are comparatively larger. The travel sector depends heavily on financial transactions, and Blockchain technology has the potential to both streamline and secure payments. This is particularly valid when dealing with payments from abroad. As a result, Blockchain has the ability to raise trust levels amongst all stakeholders.</p>



<p>This section was about the benefits of Blockchain to the travel and tourism industry. In the further section, let&#8217;s discuss the impact of Blockchain in detail.</p>



<h2>Impact of Blockchain on the travel and tourism industry</h2>



<ul><li><strong>A Secure Mode of Payment with Cryptocurrencies</strong></li></ul>



<p>Blockchain technology can be applied to the travel sector to enable direct, secure payments between two parties without needing an intermediary. This is so that it can perhaps use other <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/best-penny-cryptocurrency-to-invest-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">cryptocurrencies</a>, like Bitcoin, without the involvement of a third party.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Helpful in Baggage Management</strong></li></ul>



<p>Losing baggage is one of the worst things that can occur when traveling. However, tracking and recovering missing luggage is a highly useful application of Blockchain technology. Additionally, there is a substantial chance of reducing luggage mistreatment and loss. The government can track and locate misplaced luggage by using Blockchain data.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Identification of Potential Clients</strong></li></ul>



<p>The need for verification at various stages is eliminated when data is stored on the Blockchain. It would be sufficient to confirm the customer&#8217;s identification at the beginning, which may save a significant amount of time for both the security personnel and the clients. Therefore, according to experts, Blockchain technology is essential for smart tourism.</p>



<ul><li><strong>The Customer Reward Program</strong></li></ul>



<p>Services that adopt and utilize Blockchain technology may potentially use cryptocurrencies to recognize their loyal customers. They can use this for their next vacation and can save funds. This also eliminates the requirement for a third-party mediator.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Genuine Business Ratings</strong></li></ul>



<p>Customers&#8217; reviews can be acquired via Blockchain, providing users with accurate information. Since all of the data in the network is safe, accessible, and reliable, this will boost transparency and win trust among customers.</p>



<h2>Bottom line</h2>



<p>Traveling ought to be convenient, affordable, and most of all, pleasurable. While the existing travel landscape in India may be characterized by fees, booking problems, negative reviews, and long lineups, Blockchain is challenging this status quo with numerous innovative services intended to modernize and simplify the travel experience.</p>



<p>In this article, we have learned how this <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/why-is-cross-chain-technology-crucial-in-blockchain-interoperability/" data-wpel-link="internal">technology</a> can transform India&#8217;s travel and tourism industry. Stay tuned to learn more about varied industries that are primarily impacted by Blockchain technology.</p>

<h2>What is Blockchain?</h2>



<p>A blockchain is a series of blocks, as its name implies. The block is digital data stored in a public database. Every time the blockchain includes new information, a new block is added. Blockchain was created as a distributed ledger system, which allows data to be stored on multiple nodes at once. This means that it becomes difficult for malicious elements to access or tamper with data, which is especially essential when dealing with sensitive information like patient records and medical history.</p>



<p>Blockchain-based solutions can quickly aggregate data to help industries realize their full potential while integrating other cutting-edge technologies, like augmented reality (AR), the internet of things (IoT), and 3D printing.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Healthcare Industry</h2>



<p>Improvements in the nation&#8217;s healthcare industry are the need of the hour. With a pandemic on our heads, it has become crucial to consider ideas to ensure that the sector provides cost-effective care for all. Increased ability of healthcare organizations to provide cost-effective care can be guaranteed by improved data sharing between healthcare professionals, which increases the likelihood of correct diagnoses, more efficient treatments, and overall effectiveness of care. </p>



<p>By enabling them to track the origin of the medical ailments in a patient&#8217;s records and any other modifications made, blockchain can enable different stakeholders in the Indian healthcare value-chain to share access to various networks without compromising data security and integrity.</p>



<h2>How can blockchain disrupt healthcare?</h2>



<p>Blockchain in healthcare is not just about the technology itself. It&#8217;s also about how it can improve the quality of care and make it more accessible to patients. Various industries have started integrating the technology over the past few years, but there are still many undetermined answers about how the technology will impact healthcare organizations going forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some experts believe that blockchain can help improve security in health records by creating a secure and immutable database; that can only be accessed by authorized users; others believe that blockchain could protect the patients&#8217; data from hackers.</p>



<p>However, there are some promising cues suggesting that blockchain could have an impact on healthcare organizations in the years ahead:</p>



<h3><strong>Patient Data Management</strong></h3>



<p>One of the most compelling and vital developments in this area is the idea of using blockchain to store patient records and consent to access them. This would allow patients to retain control over their data while still allowing access to health professionals who need it.</p>



<h3><strong>Pharmaceutical Logistics</strong></h3>



<p>Blockchain can benefit capacity monitoring and environmental control in the pharma supply chain if integrated with IoT. For example, vaccines can be tracked and transported such that they are delivered on time. In addition, the technology will curb the spoilage of perishable pharma goods and ensure the transport of containers to healthcare facilities within the stipulated time of them exhausting their inventory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To understand how blockchain integration can help the logistics industry as a whole, <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-will-blockchain-technology-impact-the-logistics-industry/" data-wpel-link="internal">read here.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Identity Management &amp; Patient-Provider Transparency&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>In the healthcare industry, accessing complete and correct patient data can be cumbersome and time-consuming. Blockchain-based medical records can help solve this problem by creating a single data ecosystem that physicians and healthcare facilities can consult. In addition, the technology&#8217;s decentralized structure creates a single ecosystem of patient data that can be swiftly and effectively consulted by physicians, medical facilities, pharmacists, and anyone else involved. This is how the blockchain can result in quicker diagnoses and individualized treatment strategies.</p>



<h3><strong>Research</strong></h3>



<p>Numerous studies delving into genetics, genomics, and understanding ailments through genetic disorders require securely storing enormous volumes of genetic data points. This is where blockchain technology can be beneficial. Blockchain applications are a great approach to strengthen genomics understanding and assist scientists in gathering and securely storing essential data.</p>



<h3><strong>Transactions</strong></h3>



<p>Blockchain can enable smart contracts that automatically handle bills and payments. Hence, reducing processing times, ensuring correctness, and preserving and sharing digital data. Furthermore, this will also allow insurance companies to process the policies faster and according to the prescribed guidelines. Patients can also make their payments through crypto.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Though still in its infancy, blockchain technology&#8217;s research and initial applications are promising. We have already seen an explosion of technological solutions that have significantly impacted medical care. Further, implementing blockchain technology will create numerous opportunities for the healthcare industry, allowing for a significant transformation of the sector. Its implementation will provide all stakeholders with substantial benefits. As blockchain technology is still a novelty for most participants in the healthcare sector, its implementation may significantly develop in the future. A massive transformation for the Indian Healthcare sector is coming!</p>

<p>Even though cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile, when a bear market hits, the investors are startled, and their faith in the asset class is shaken. Bear markets are a common component of the financial ecology, despite being bad for our portfolios.</p>



<p>Many investors are withdrawing their funds due to the fear of massive losses. We should try to understand that there is no need to fear, as this is a natural market response to news making the rounds and the broader macroeconomic environment. In fact, another set of investors prefers to view market crashes as an opportunity to buy more assets at a discount. If there is one thing we can be sure of with <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-cryptocurrency/" data-wpel-link="internal">cryptocurrency</a>, it is that it cannot be eradicated, and this is not the end of the asset class. The remarkable comeback from the crypto winter of 2018 is evidence that the cryptocurrency market and community are incredibly resilient.</p>



<p>Here are the top coins that we should keep an eye on during this Crypto Winter:</p>



<h2>Top coins that will survive the crypto crash</h2>



<h4><li><strong>Bitcoin (BTC)</strong></li></h4>



<p>Bitcoin was introduced by a person or a group named Satoshi Nakamoto. BTC, the original cryptocurrency, is supported by practically all crypto communities. Offshoots like Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash were also produced from its blockchain and software. Both want to be the cryptocurrency used most frequently for daily transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In November 2021, <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/BTC-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">BTC</a> reached a 52-week high of $68,700 before beginning a protracted decline. Bitcoin has suffered significant losses over the past seven months, falling roughly 70% between November 2021 and mid-June. From its 52-week low, Bitcoin has gained some ground and is trading at about $20,400. Experts predict that the coin will reach $75,000 by the end of 2022. Check the current BTC prices <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/BTC-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">here</a>. </p>



<h4><li><strong>Ethereum (ETH)</strong></li></h4>



<p>Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, was multiplying manifolds before the market crashed. <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/ETH-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">ETH</a> is famous for its growing popularity as an investment vehicle. This growth is because Ethereum is seen as a safer way to invest than Bitcoin, which has become notorious for its volatility and wild price swings.</p>



<p>Ethereum has produced a fascinating universe of decentralized applications. On the Ethereum Network, a vast ecosystem of projects, tokens, and dapps have been developed. Therefore, even if Ethereum suffers a setback, it still has the backing of hundreds of users close to the community who will try to keep the network active. With an all-time high of $3500 in 2021, ETH will soon pull through the storm of crypto winter. </p>



<h4><li><strong>Tether (USDT)</strong></li></h4>



<p>Investors invest in stablecoins to provide security and stability to their assets during a crypto market crisis. <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/USDT-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">USDT</a> is a coin that can be easily exchanged for other currencies. It is built on the public ledger of Bitcoin, so it&#8217;s always available to use, and you&#8217;ll never have to worry about fluctuating value.</p>



<p>USDT was introduced in 2017 by Tether Ltd, which is based in Hong Kong. Tether aims to provide an alternative to fiat currency by using blockchain technology, allowing them to create a digital currency with no volatility. To maintain stability, USDT primarily balances another cryptocurrency through pair exchanging.</p>



<h4><li><strong>USD Coin (USDC)</strong></li></h4>



<p>The entire backing of USD Coin (<a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/USDC-USDT" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">USDC</a>) is provided by dollars-denominated assets. One USDC coin has the same value as one US dollar, making USDC a tokenized version of the dollar. Being a stablecoin, USDC is intended to have a constant value. Similar to USDT, most of USDC’s supporters are users attempting to avoid excessive volatility. </p>



<p>Influenced by the dollar value, USD Coin gains from the weak fiat markets. Many consumers will choose USDC as a steady pair to fend off the losses. Hence, the coin will persevere through the crypto winter. </p>



<h4><li><strong>Cardano (ADA)</strong></li></h4>



<p>As the first third-generation cryptocurrency, <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/ADA-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">ADA</a> claims to address scaling and infrastructure issues that were first experienced by both ethereum, a second-generation cryptocurrency that expanded the use cases for coins to include smart contracts, and bitcoin, a first-generation cryptocurrency that introduced the concept of digital coins. In addition, Cardano seeks explicitly to address sustainability, interoperability, and scalability issues on cryptocurrency systems. </p>



<p>According to experts, ADA will flourish shortly. This is because the digitization of money will heavily impact the market, making it clear that coins like Cardano (ADA) will only continue to increase.</p>



<h4><li><strong>Dogecoin (DOGE)</strong></li></h4>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/DOGE-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Dogecoin</a> (DOGE) is a cryptocurrency that was introduced as a &#8220;joke currency&#8221; but has grown like no other meme coin. Dogecoin was developed with the aim to create “a fun place to share images, stories, and news related to dogs.” </p>



<p>The community around Dogecoin has evolved rapidly over the years, with many people now using it as an alternative to major coins such as Bitcoin or Litecoin. Dogecoin’s slogan is “to the moon!” which reflects its goal of reaching a $1 billion market cap by 2021. The community is HODLing and is sure that this isn’t the end for DOGE. </p>



<h4><li><strong>Solana (SOL)</strong></li></h4>



<p>Solana was founded in 2017 by David Sonstebo, co-founder of IOTA and the Ethereum Foundation. The <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/SOL-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Solana</a> platform was designed to host decentralized, scalable applications. Founded in 2017, Solana is an open-source project currently run by Solana Foundation based in Geneva, while San Francisco-based Solana Labs built the blockchain. Solana has a fast transaction processing speed, significantly quicker than Ethereum. It also has lower transaction fees when compared to rival blockchains like Ethereum. Disrupting the technology, Solana is going to grow leaps and bounds, according to experts. </p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>The crypto market has had an ATH of $3 Trillion. Eradicating crypto is impossible since it was designed to be disruptive and embark on a new financial age. A bear market caused by the waxing and waning of typical macro cycles won&#8217;t be able to halt cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency will recover, even though some people might lose money, some may HODL, and others may even buy more. For investors, it&#8217;s simply an opportunity to buy more.</p>

<p>In this blog, we&#8217;ll concentrate on the benefits of blockchain technology for the logistics sector in India and how it affects that sector. But, first, let&#8217;s start by understanding what blockchain is.</p>



<h2>What is Blockchain?</h2>



<p>Blockchain is a distributed database technology that stores digital information records securely and transparently without needing a centralized control system. The technology was initially created as the accounting system for the digital currency Bitcoin, but it is now primarily used to code and insert almost any document into the blockchain, as well as to verify transactions between digital currencies. Doing this produces a permanent, immutable record. In addition, instead of relying on a single centralized authority, the blockchain enables the entire community to verify the document&#8217;s authenticity independently.</p>



<p>Besides the use of blockchain technology to power cryptocurrency networks, there are other use cases of the technology. But before we talk about the implementation, there are several unanswered questions regarding the future of blockchain, like when it will be integrated into the traditional industries and when it will provide fruitful outcomes. Although, we are close to answering these questions. Recently, we have seen the integration of blockchain in various sectors, like healthcare, <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-will-blockchain-technology-impact-the-education-industry/" data-wpel-link="internal">education</a>, <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-will-blockchain-technology-impact-the-media-entertainment-industry/" data-wpel-link="internal">media &amp; entertainment</a>, and logistics.</p>



<h2>Logistics Industry</h2>



<p>With more stakeholders involved in supply chains directly or indirectly, logistics is becoming more and more complex. Several issues along the supply chain are impacting the effectiveness of logistics functions. The location of packages is frequently unknown while they are being transported, making it challenging to plan delivery timeframes and underusing the resources of businesses. Additionally, establishing a reliable audit trail is becoming more critical due to rising sustainability expectations. However, tracking products across the whole supply chain can be challenging.</p>



<p>Additionally, various logistics operations in India are still tracked by hand and on paper, which might result in lengthy processing delays. Because of these issues, this complexity demands end-to-end visibility and communication; logistics operations are becoming less effective. As a result, the demand for transparency and dependability in the sector is rising among all supply chain actors in the nation simultaneously. Blockchain is becoming a potential answer to these problems.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>How can blockchain change the face of Supply Chain?</h2>



<p>Blockchain in logistics can be employed to manage the supply chain more efficiently; parties can keep track of price, date, location, quality, certification, and other pertinent information using a blockchain. The availability of this data on the network can improve visibility and compliance over outsourced contract manufacturing, increase traceability of the material supply chain, reduce losses to grey market and counterfeit products, and possibly strengthen an organization&#8217;s position as a pioneer in ethical manufacturing. Let us understand how blockchain can revolutionize Logistics:</p>



<h3><strong>Improved Freight tracking</strong></h3>



<p>The primary use case of blockchain in logistics is to track the shipment transparently, i.e., by all parties involved. Commercial transportation companies have an ever-increasing demand to innovate as the need for same-day delivery rises and consumer expectations rise. Blockchain networks can contribute and confirm data by leveraging the blockchain for data authentication, making it impervious to tampering. Increased tracking data dependability can also help in reducing the spoilage of perishable goods.</p>



<h3><strong>Invoicing &amp; Payments</strong></h3>



<p>Organizations involved in Logistical operations usually maintain paper-based and manual records. Numerous parties are involved in the process, which amounts to loads of paper-based handwritten data. This causes a huge issue when it comes to invoicing. Companies spend a lot of time matching invoices with payments that are due or that have been credited. Blockchain can enable smart contracts that automatically handle bills and payments, reducing processing times, ensuring correctness, and preserving and sharing digital data.</p>



<h3><strong>Tracking Fleet &amp; Vehicle performance</strong></h3>



<p>The value of tracking extends beyond delivery effectiveness. It also applies to the efficiency of particular vehicles in a fleet. For example, the blockchain can assist in authenticating data on the past performance of the vehicle and its maintenance history when a business wishes to buy a used delivery-service vehicle. Additionally, a company with a massive fleet of vehicles can easily track the performance of the vehicles they own.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>IoT and AI with Blockchain Integration</strong></h3>



<p>Blockchain can benefit capacity monitoring and environmental control if integrated with IoT. For example, the price of shipping freight is frequently proportional to the cargo volume. Shippers and transportation providers can assess the cost of a package based on the amount of space it takes up using IoT sensors in trucks and other shipping vehicles and can then send this data to the blockchain.</p>



<p>For instance, when the COVID-19 vaccine was introduced, there was a wave of relief in the nation. But one major issue that sustained was how to transport these vaccines far and wide across India. The temperatures in our country can vary from region to region, which could pose a risk of vaccine spoilage. Hence, the vaccine had to be transported in a temperature-controlled environment. The logistics of various pharmaceutical drugs require special vehicles and transportation modes for temperature control. This increases the administrative cost and poses the risk of spoilage due to changes in temperature across various areas. Hence, using blockchain, stakeholders can track and control the temperature of the containers.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Blockchain will revolutionize the Indian logistics industry in the future. Mutual confidence between participants will improve the efficiency of the transaction verification process and contribute to the timely delivery of products and services. However, it can take several years to fully integrate this procedure into logistics.</p>

<p>Brick-and-mortar stores in India are still lagging in adopting Blockchain technology. Additionally, Blockchain technology has been the foundation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. However, over the past few years, there has been a change in perspective as more and more businesses have begun to see the potential of this technology.</p>



<p>This shift results from the more significant digital revolution that is occurring throughout the retail industry. Therefore, you can say that Blockchain is essential to the future of retail as it quietly works away in the background.</p>



<p>Blockchain offers a mechanism to establish trust between merchants, payment gateways, and customers while enhancing transparency, credibility, and confidence in various business activities. As more Indian consumers prefer to transact through online media sources, increased trust can only help the retail sector.</p>



<p>We have curated a list of industries that can benefit from Blockchain technology. You can check all the blogs here:</p>

<p>In this article, let&#8217;s have a look at the impact of Blockchain technology on the Indian retail industry.</p>



<p>Before we delve into the advantages of Blockchain in the retail industry, let&#8217;s have a quick overview of Blockchain.</p>



<h2>Blockchain: An overview</h2>



<p>Blockchain fundamentally functions as a distributed database that a network of computers can access (distributed ledger). Once a record is added to the block, it becomes immutable (ledger). The network nodes routinely check for the most recent release of the Blockchain To ensure that every copy of the database is the exact same.</p>



<p>Blockchain focuses on decentralized <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/p2p-dispute-resolution-now-easier/" data-wpel-link="internal">Peer-to-Peer</a> (P2P) transactions (including money or digital assets) that are not under the authority of a single centralized organization. The database is transparent and maintains a thorough record of every transaction. Complex cryptographic protocols are used to safeguard Blockchains, and only public and private keys may be used to access them.</p>



<h2>Impact of Blockchain technology on the retail industry</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Maintaining product quality</strong></li></ul>



<p>The use of Blockchain technology has clear implications for determining a product&#8217;s origin, authenticity, and state. Let&#8217;s take an example, the Internet of Things (IoT) enables sensors to monitor perishable items and store temperature data on a secure digital ledger.</p>



<p>This technology allows retailers to recall items and address supply chain problems.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Tackling fraud</strong></li></ul>



<p>The annual cost of fraud to the world economy is estimated to be $5.38 trillion. The advantages of an impermeable digital information ledger are clear in this situation. For instance, businesses may use the Blockchain to ensure that invoices don&#8217;t change hands between suppliers and buyers to prevent procurement fraud. In addition, fraud is partially reduced because all parties must confirm transactions.</p>



<p>Retailers can ensure the authenticity of products when they are monitored on the Blockchain since counterfeit goods would not have this history of verification. But, of course, for Blockchain to perform this function, maintaining the accuracy of the data recorded into the ledger is necessary.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Managing consumer data</strong></li></ul>



<p>As organizations continue to gather customer data in more significant quantities than before, they are required to manage them properly.</p>



<p>Decentralized Identity (DID), which allows people to maintain their personal information outside of corporate systems, is made possible by Blockchain technology. DID enables the data to be saved on the Blockchain along with any links pointing to it, making it possible to verify user identification and data as necessary.</p>



<p>Using a DID instead of an email address makes it less likely that someone would trace a user&#8217;s web behavior and put together the information entered on several websites to create a comprehensive picture of the person.</p>



<ul><li><strong>More effective payment systems</strong></li></ul>



<p>Since the mainstream has formally embraced cryptocurrencies, retailers who do not accept them might profit from changing their payment methods. The organizations that are payment service providers let their customers purchase and send money using a variety of digital currencies, while other firms are also enabling similar transactions through their platforms.</p>



<p>Blockchain, however, is relevant to payments in areas more than only <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/the-future-of-cryptocurrency-in-india-10-faqs-answered/" data-wpel-link="internal">cryptocurrency</a>. For example, it can reduce the cost of maintaining the infrastructure for financial services by eliminating the requirement for authentication overheads.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Tracking inventory</strong></li></ul>



<p>In the retail sector, efficient inventory management is essential. Among other advantages, better control lowers inventory costs, enhances order fulfillment and customer happiness, simplifies supply chain management, and boosts forecasts and profit margins.</p>



<p>Giving inventory units, orders, and bills of lading—as well as the supply chain stakeholders that work with those assets—individual Blockchain identifiers provide unalterable visibility into every stage of the supply chain.</p>



<h2>Final thoughts</h2>



<p>Many parts of the retail industry might be altered by Blockchain technology. This industry still deals with a number of concerns that have the potential to become problems in the future, even though it is now highly potent on its own. However, when we talk about the Indian retail industry, this sector can address all its issues and add additional customer advantages by employing Blockchain.</p>

<p>The popularity of cryptocurrencies has grown due to several factors, including privacy and anonymity. Some of them assist users in concealing their identification and transactional information. However, users are looking for alternative solutions as apprehensions about the anonymity of early cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, grow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Privacy being the basis of Defi, all cryptocurrencies are private in the conventional sense.&nbsp; No central body controls cryptocurrencies; hence, the ownership remains private.&nbsp; However, in the context of cryptocurrencies, &#8220;private&#8221; and &#8220;public&#8221; relates to the degree of secrecy that a given coin offers.</p>



<h2>What is a private cryptocurrency?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>A class of cryptocurrencies offering anonymous blockchain transactions is a private cryptocurrency or privacy coin. Some strategies used in trading bitcoin assets include disguising a user&#8217;s actual wallet balance and address and combining numerous transactions to avoid chain analysis to hide the source and destination of cryptocurrency transactions.</p>



<p>On the other hand, by enabling anybody to conduct chain analyses and observe public addresses and transactions in their network, non-private blockchains like Bitcoin and others offer transparency. This makes monitoring a person&#8217;s bitcoin and other publicly traded cryptocurrencies deposits and withdrawals feasible.</p>



<p>Private cryptocurrencies, however, provide untraceability and anonymity. While untraceability renders it practically impossible for other parties to retrace the trail of transactions using services like blockchain analysis, obscurity obscures the identity behind a transaction.</p>



<h2>5 Private Cryptocurrencies List You Should Know About</h2>



<ol><li><strong>Monero (XMR)</strong></li></ol>



<p>Monero provides a high level of transaction and user privacy. While Monero and Bitcoin are both decentralized peer-to-peer cryptocurrencies, Monero is distinguished as being more anonymous or privacy-oriented than Bitcoin. The anonymization attribute of Monero has contributed significantly to its growing popularity in the cryptocurrency community. Every bitcoin user receives a public address, also known as a key, that is specific to them.</p>



<p>Even though the sender is aware of the recipient&#8217;s public address, using Monero does not grant access to a window view of the recipient&#8217;s holdings. Transactions made with Monero cannot be linked to or tracked. Coins sent to a recipient are redirected through a unique address created at random for the transaction. Check the prices of Monero in the USDT market <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/XMR-USDT" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">here.&nbsp;</a></p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Zcash (ZEC)</strong></li></ol>



<p>Zcash is another private crypto<a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/zec-USDT" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer"> available in India</a>. When a group of researchers decided they wanted to develop a cryptocurrency comparable to Bitcoin, but with some extra features, ZCash was born in 2016. They created a Bitcoin blockchain split that has improved user security and anonymity. Zerocash, which the scientists initially created as Zerocoin, was introduced not long after. The cryptocurrency was eventually called ZCash.</p>



<p>ZCash does not remove information about transactions. Instead, it encrypts it to prevent tracking. The security protocol zk-SNARK increases user security and anonymity while keeping the ZCash blockchain encrypted.</p>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Dash (DASH)</strong></li></ol>



<p>Dash, introduced in 2014, was formerly known as Xcoin. It was initially built with the intention of protecting user anonymity and privacy. The company has now recast its goals, albeit it still includes robust encryption capabilities. With the ability to be used as cash, a credit card, or through PayPal, Dash now wants to be a tool for everyday transactions. An open-source project called Dash has a decentralized payment network built-in.</p>



<p>&#8220;Masternodes,&#8221; a subset of Dash&#8217;s users, is in charge of running the network. The validation and verification of transactions are made more accessible by master nodes. Each master node has a beginning stake in their respective systems equal to 1,000 DASH. Additionally, it addresses the issue of transactions&#8217; scalability. This is because the quantity of nodes needed to authorize a transaction is decreased to a tolerable level. Masternodes are in charge of authorizing transactions from the miner network and providing the Dash network services like payment and privacy. You can look into the prices of Dash <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/dash-USDT" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>



<ol start="4"><li><strong>Verge (XVG)</strong></li></ol>



<p>The open-source, decentralized cryptocurrency Verge (XVG) boasts that it offers anonymous transactions by masking the participants&#8217; IP addresses and locations. Verge trades under the <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/xvg-USDT" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">XVG ticker</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By masking users&#8217; IP addresses, Verge strongly emphasizes anonymity. An IP address is a numeric identifier connected to a particular computer or computer network. Obfuscating IP addresses renders transactions entirely untraceable; using an IP address, it is possible to track the user and the online activities they carried out on the connected device.</p>



<p>The entire anonymity of participants is difficult to protect with several well-known cryptocurrencies. As a result, private ledgers that provide distinctive ways to conceal users&#8217; identities are becoming increasingly popular due to cryptocurrencies like Verge.</p>



<ol start="5"><li><strong>Beam (BEAM)</strong></li></ol>



<p>Beam is a privacy coin that seeks to explore confidential DeFi. It uses the Mimblewimble protocol, which hides transaction values and metadata while thinning out the blockchain and enhancing scalability. LelantusMW&#8217;s most recent development seeks to deliver privacy and anonymity on all fronts. The goal of Beam is to give people total control over their finances. The team is creating a new blockchain to offer a secure, decentralized, and practical means of value storage and exchange and a robust self-governing community to foster its growth and support. To purchase beam and go through the prices, <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/beam-USDT" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">click here</a>.</p>



<h2>Bottom Line</h2>



<p>In the virtual world, anonymity is highly desired, but it also carries the risk of consequential criminal activity. Operators of cryptocurrencies like exchanges need to devise a system to prevent frequent efforts at hacking by malicious parties and mandate KYC to ensure smooth law enforcement if required. The regulators have voiced serious concerns over Privacy Coins. Infrastructure is needed in the industry to confirm the legitimate owner of cryptographic assets.</p>

<p>The intriguing thing is that the media and entertainment industries are particularly suited for a blockchain revolution and benefit substantially from the technology&#8217;s many opportunities. So let&#8217;s explore the impact of this technology, especially on the Indian media and entertainment industry, in this blog.</p>



<h2>An overview of Blockchain technology</h2>



<p>The technology initially intended to serve as the foundation for Bitcoin is now available for use in several new business applications and industries. Essentially, it makes it possible for transactions to be executed between a sender and a recipient in a network without the necessity for a central authority, thereby boosting speed and lowering transaction costs.</p>



<p>A blockchain is basically a distributed ledger in the digital realm. It captures transactions in virtually real-time, chronologically, and immutably.</p>



<p>The agreement of the nodes in the network is necessary before a transaction can be added to the ledger. It offers a continuous control method for data quality, manipulation, and mistakes.</p>



<h2>Role of Blockchain in the media and entertainment industry</h2>



<p>Along the media value chain, many stakeholders have recently arisen. It includes artists as the primary content producers, aggregators, and network providers, in addition to a third party handling royalty payments (depending on the country and type of media).</p>



<p>Blockchain applications have the potential to change industries drastically.</p>



<p>Bypassing content aggregators, organizations that collect royalties, and network providers are made possible by the technology. This will give the content owners control over the market. Since the Indian media and entertainment industry is vast, this technology can be a boon for the main stakeholders. As a result, future blockchain-based payment and contract solutions eliminate complex components of the media and entertainment value chain risk.</p>



<p>In fact, this disruption has the potential to fundamentally alter how pricing, publicity, revenue sharing, and royalties are paid. The centralized authority could no longer be necessary for transactions or advertisement sales. Financial transactions could be less expensive, and the distribution of profits may be automated if predefined <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-are-smart-contracts-and-why-you-need-to-know-about-them/" data-wpel-link="internal">smart contract</a> solutions are used.</p>



<h2>Impact of Blockchain technology on the media and entertainment industry</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Decreases IP infringement&nbsp;</strong></li></ul>



<p>The media and entertainment industries have to pay a high price for digital piracy, fake copies, intellectual property (IP) infringement by studios, and the duplication of virtual content. Enterprise Ethereum enables artists and producers to manage and maintain IP rights on a time-stamped, immutable ledger and digitize the metadata of their original content. In addition, it is simpler for creators to protect their rights when a legal infringement happens because of a blockchain&#8217;s append-only nature.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Reduces dependency on intermediaries</strong></li></ul>



<p>Intermediaries abound in the media and entertainment industries. According to a report, the US music business spends an all-time high of $43 billion annually, while artists only receive $5 billion, or approximately 12% of that total.</p>



<p>On-demand streaming services like YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music, and Soundcloud are intermediaries and key participants in the music business, such as record labels, music publishers, music managers, and music distributors.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Enables micropayments</strong></li></ul>



<p>The blockchain keeps track of each use of a piece of content once a content provider has registered it on the network. Real-time, adaptable, and completely transparent consumption-based pricing techniques, such as metered billing, are made possible by this tracking. In addition, automatic micropayments among the viewer and the creator can be carried out through smart contracts.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Enables P2P sales and content distribution</strong></li></ul>



<p>With the help of Ethereum, artists can automate a sizable percentage of the administrative tasks related to contracts, licensing, and payments. As a result, creators can distribute their work directly peer to peer after the contractual-based activity, which is often replete with intermediaries, is automated and executed at a fraction of the cost.</p>



<p>Markets for digital content built on the blockchain enable direct communication between producers and consumers without the necessity of expensive intermediaries.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Streamlining royalty payments</strong></li></ul>



<p>Artists can submit original works, self-publish, manage distribution, and control license choices on a platform built on the blockchain. Every piece of content&#8217;s royalty payments could be incorporated into a smart contract and set up to be paid to the creator whenever it is used.</p>



<h2>Final thoughts: Future of the media and entertainment industry</h2>



<p>Over the past few decades, the Indian media and entertainment industry has experienced notable expansion. The issue with the industry, though, has been the domination of just a few creamy layers of content-producing corporations and music recording giants who make vast sums of money. At the same time, the rest aren&#8217;t given their fair share.</p>



<p>The industry&#8217;s challenges can be significantly reduced by using blockchain technology and quickening the development of <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-google-doing-with-blockchain/" data-wpel-link="internal">blockchain</a> solutions. In addition, the widespread adoption by an increasing number of Indian media and entertainment companies can force the sector to embrace a more fair, open, and improved approach while also offering doable solutions that alter how we use media and absorb information.</p>

<p>eCash (XEC) is a cryptocurrency intended to be used as electronic cash. It aims to be used as a payment mode for transactions for goods and services and envisions redefining wealth altogether.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Transactions in eCash are made directly between the user and the person they are paying or receiving money from; hence, there is no need to possess a bank account; only an electronic wallet is needed. Anyone can receive an eCash token once they have a wallet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Want to know more about XEC? We have got you covered. Read on more about how to <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/XEC-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">buy XEC in INR</a>, XEC coin prediction in INR, and where to <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/XEC-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">buy XEC in INR</a>. </p>



<h2>What is eCash (XEC)?</h2>



<p>Ecash combines the core functionalities of Bitcoin &#8211; fixed supply, genesis block, and halving schedule &#8211; with the energy-efficient Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus and protocol governance. The platform uses the Avalanche consensus algorithm to avoid the chances of forks that have, in the past, removed large amounts of value from many projects. The XEC team promises to incorporate both the Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake consensus to improve XEC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ECash (XEC) is led by Amaury Sechet, who was the lead developer of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and forked that blockchain to create Bitcoin Cash ABC (BCHA) on November 15, 2020. Bitcoin Cash is itself a fork of Bitcoin. Sechet chose to rebrand Bitcoin Cash ABC on July 1, 2021 and renamed it eCash with the token ticker XEC.&nbsp; The rebranding was done to build a new brand identity for eCash distinct from Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Users were allowed to exchange 1 BCHA token for 1 million XEC. eCash tokens are of smaller denominations to facilitate easily measurable transactions. Sechet was of the belief that reducing the number of decimal places would aid in the coin&#8217;s adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sechet said, “No other money has eight decimal places. Why should crypto? <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/top-cryptocurrencies-you-should-buy-and-hold-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">Cryptocurrencies</a> with a lower unit price also enjoy higher bull market appreciation. Because the eCash team is incentivized by both tech and price improvement, this improvement was a no-brainer.”</p>



<p>It&#8217;s available in every country and can be used to send and receive cross-border payments from anywhere without the need for a bank account. eCash uses ”bits” that make it easy to send small payments because you no longer have to handle unwieldy decimal places.</p>



<h2>How does eCash (XEC) Work?</h2>



<p>The multi-layered approach of the eCash network combines a privacy-focused blockchain with an EVM Subchain to make it simple for developers to create Dapps. The EVM designation means that Ethereum developers can port or expand their existing Dapps to the eCash network without reprogramming their code. The platform developers intended to make the coin EVM-compatible and interoperable with the Defi sector on the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/ethereum-eth-vs-ethereum-classic-etc/" data-wpel-link="internal">ETH network</a>. </p>



<p>To ensure the coin’s success, the developers have five goals to fulfill, including anonymity in transactions, the immutability of transactions, guaranteeing almost free transactions, transaction finality of three seconds, and designing the coin’s infrastructure as a public good.<br></p>



<p>On the eCash system, anyone can build customized tokens. The system eliminates the conventional technical requirements. Using the platform&#8217;s dashboard, you may create a unique token name, supply, decimal places, and icon. This capability enhances the network&#8217;s usefulness by allowing enterprises to develop new revenue-generating tactics and enter whole new markets.</p>



<p>eCash&#8217;s native wallet named Sighash is used to boost security. The system allows users to keep track of their holdings and sell, trade, and <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/XEC-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">buy XEC in INR</a> and other currencies. This interface also allows users to keep track of their staking rewards.</p>



<p>By staking XEC tokens, users gain rewards and more. Staking protects the network while also providing a low-risk passive income stream. Staking is less risky than trading because your payouts are predetermined based on the number of tokens you stake.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The customers can partake in the validation process without buying expensive mining rigs due to the unique Proof-of-Stake technology.&nbsp; The network&#8217;s adaptive block size can expand up to 1TB, while Bitcoin has a 1MB block size. This method enables near-real-time processing and transaction completion on the network.</p>

<p>In this blog, we will focus on how Blockchain technology impacts the Education industry in India and what its advantages are to the industry. Let&#8217;s begin!</p>



<h2>What is Blockchain?</h2>



<p>The term &#8220;Blockchain&#8221; refers to a system of digital databases or ledgers where data is kept in the form of &#8220;blocks&#8221; that are connected to form &#8220;<a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/introduction-to-off-chain-protocols/" data-wpel-link="internal">chains</a>.&#8221; With the innovation of the Internet of Things (IoT), affordable computing and internet services became accessible to all; Blockchain technology can now support advancements across a range of processes and applications needing management, storage, recovery, and safety of vast and significant information.</p>



<p>A decentralized structure makes the system and the data it stores trustworthy, transparent, and fraud-proof.</p>



<h2>Need for Blockchain in the education industry</h2>



<p>The term &#8220;Blockchain&#8221; comes to mind when security is an issue. When we look into data breaches, education is also not far away. Cybercriminals are in high demand for student information that contains minimal financial information. At the same time, student verification is becoming a significant issue at education institutions that are compromised to produce false identities and records. Therefore, protecting student privacy becomes more critical as student information becomes more digital.</p>



<p>The verification procedure is only used at the school or college level. Defending employers, for instance, from those falsely claiming to hold degrees. As a developing nation, India is taking solid steps to protect the education industry&#8217;s stakeholders. Blockchain can be a powerful tool for combating fraudulent qualifications and degrees in the job.</p>



<h2>Applications of Blockchain: What will it do?</h2>



<ul><li>Blockchain technology may offer a suitable framework to handle student records, including daily data like assignments, attendance, extracurricular activities, and information regarding degrees and institutions they have attended. It would be a secure system that guarantees immutable educational records. Potential educational institutions and employers may rely on these if they can access the necessary records.</li></ul>



<ul><li>An educational institution would be able to monitor faculty performance by safely storing information about teachers. The Blockchain ledger would provide a time-stamped and tamper-proof record of teacher performance, including attendance, student ratings, the number of students choosing electives, research output, and publications. More accountability will be ensured by connecting this information to teacher evaluation systems.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The students can trust the caliber of educators and teachers. Blockchain technology could allow teachers to show their certified Skill Badges, enabling students to make educated course selections.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Students can use skill badges to show their proficiency, particularly those in higher education and research. This would allow teachers to choose the best students for projects. It is also possible to create a scholarship program that rewards students for their consistency and academic performance using a Blockchain-based ecosystem.</li></ul>



<p>The application of Blockchain in Indian education might enhance the ecosystem&#8217;s efficiency and maximize the use of financial and human resources.</p>



<h2>Benefits to the Education industry</h2>



<ul><li><strong>In the Field of University Research</strong></li></ul>



<p>Professors spend a lot of time performing original research, publishing their findings, expanding the boundaries of their subjects, and disclosing future-oriented study areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reach and effect of those articles are significant because they can affect researchers&#8217; ability to secure substantial funding for ongoing research. In addition, authors have a stake in monitoring how their work is used and can combat outright piracy.</p>



<p>Researchers would be able to publish without limitations but in a way that would enable them to monitor the reuse of their research. For example, how frequently their work is cited and used as teaching materials, allowing them to monitor its impact in the field, which is crucial because it can result in accolades and future funding.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Learning will be rewarded with cryptocurrencies</strong>.</li></ul>



<p>A key component of Blockchain technology is <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/tokenization-vs-encryption/" data-wpel-link="internal">tokenization</a>. Professors will soon be able to encourage students by paying them with cryptocurrencies if they score well or complete a particular major. Also, academic institutions can incentivize students to repay their debts on time. The gamification component of tokenization&#8217;s teaching methodology has shown to be quite successful.</p>



<p>Although it is still in its initial stages, Blockchain in Edtech has already been acknowledged as &#8220;the suitable technology&#8221; for modernizing an outdated system.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Enhanced visibility</strong></li></ul>



<p>Blockchain&#8217;s immutable ledger technology creates a chronological record of current events. This works well for reviewing transcripts, showing a comprehensive report card, and updating students on their progress. When students turn in an assignment using Blockchain, they cannot &#8220;lose&#8221; it or allege that the teacher misplaced it.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Lowering the Cost of Education</strong></li></ul>



<p>Blockchain technology has the ability to offer universal access to open educational resources like books, podcasts, and movies that are in the public domain and are free to use and disseminate, in addition to supporting lifelong learning. Furthermore, Blockchain enables the inexpensive and secure sharing of these resources in a public network.</p>



<p>Blockchain can change the educational ecosystem by creating new, more accessible channels for learning and upending the current relationship between schools and students.</p>



<h2>Bottom line</h2>



<p>Through <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-app-why-wazirx-is-the-best/" data-wpel-link="internal">cryptocurrencies</a>, Blockchains have already altered the economic environment. Blockchain use in the Indian education system will improve resource usage and the effectiveness of the school environment. The recruiting process will be made easier, data security and trust will be enhanced, and students will have lifetime ownership of their academic records thanks to record-keeping and sharing streamlining.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency is a brand-new class of digital assets that are growing in popularity constantly. However, many folks are hesitant to invest in it since it is so new and unknown. People are also reluctant to invest in cryptocurrencies for a variety of reasons. First of all, there is a gap in knowledge regarding the recently popular digital asset, which is just a decade old. Many financial organizations still refer to <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrency-app-why-wazirx-is-the-best/" data-wpel-link="internal">Cryptocurrency</a> as a buzzword and do not inform their clientele of its definition or use.</p>



<p>Like any cutting-edge technology, Cryptocurrency took some time for people to adopt it. For instance, it took time for people to understand and have faith in the internet. Crypto is currently going through a similar period. Although people are still discovering how to swim in it, they will eventually learn to enjoy it. We&#8217;re here to help you overcome your fear about making Crypto investments as a newbie investor.</p>



<p>Read the blog to learn some tips to overcome your fear.</p>



<h2>Understand fear</h2>



<p>You should first think about why you are so afraid of the market.</p>



<p>What drives you to doubt your abilities and question the choices you make? Is it only a matter of inexperience? Are you hesitant to take financial risks? Is this the voice of greed, and you can&#8217;t let go?</p>



<p>Maybe you are just worried about missing the opportunity to gain profit. However, it would help if you reflected on the causes of your job tardiness. As frustrating as it may be before you start to work on overcoming your anxieties, you must first recognize and acknowledge them.</p>



<p>You can deal with something once you are aware of what it is. Remember that fear is your mind&#8217;s instinctive reaction to stress or risk. That implies that the anxiety won&#8217;t disappear unless you get the confidence to handle the pressures of trading.</p>



<p>Quantifying these feelings is one method to get through them. Then, prepare your response in case the price movement you fear may occur. Finally, prepare for the scenarios that terrify you. This way, you&#8217;ll still know what to do next when things don&#8217;t go your way.</p>



<h2>Educate yourself</h2>



<p>Naturally, you&#8217;ll feel more at ease as you become more comfortable while trading. Making decisions that might impact your life every day is a difficult task to manage. But once you know about it, you&#8217;ll become used to having that responsibility.</p>



<p>Therefore, the two most effective ways to overcome fear in trading are education and experience. Without the other, one cannot exist. You must always learn about yourself, markets, and trade. In this manner, when something unforeseen occurs, you won&#8217;t be caught entirely unprepared. You will have the ability to make decisions in the face of stress and support those decisions.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, gaining experience is more complicated. It requires time. However, the harder you work, the more experience you gain.</p>



<p>So, this situation is quite paradoxical. Maybe you are too hesitant to make judgments, yet you need to work to get experience. In this case, the most crucial thing you can do is let reason rule your emotions. You know you&#8217;re confident in your abilities. Consider all of your decisions in light of your current skills and expertise.</p>



<h2>Set up rules</h2>



<p>You might use guidelines, trading strategies, and even timetables to organize your efforts.</p>



<p>You might restrict what you can or cannot do by using rules. However, while working within those constraints, there shouldn&#8217;t be any worry.</p>



<p>Time schedules help you perform more productively; if you follow them, they&#8217;ll stop analysis paralysis. Every morning, schedule a certain period for your charting and analysis and don&#8217;t return to it later in the day.</p>



<p>Your guidelines for allocating risk and making <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/6-ways-to-minimize-risks-when-investing-in-crypto/" data-wpel-link="internal">risk management</a> choices should be part of your trading rules. You should have made the decision for yourself as to when to cut your losses and when enough is enough. You may also analyze your risk-reward scenario to determine whether risks are worthwhile. You will follow your rules here and not let fear hold you back.</p>



<p>You can also enable additional triggers that could affect how you make decisions. Using your current principles, you will know what situations can cause you to sell or acquire shares.</p>



<p>Of course, setting boundaries for financial losses will help reduce your fear. As you have prepared your restrictions, you will know when to quit or continue.</p>



<h2>Final thoughts</h2>



<p>Get back up and try again if the value of your investments decreases. You&#8217;re more likely to recover the losses if you&#8217;ve evaluated your risk tolerance and selected a strategy and assets that support your objectives. As they say, patience pays off, and this is especially true when investing.</p>

<p>Blockchain technology has been turning heads around the world since Bitcoin’s birth in 2008. But it gained mass traction in 2018 when <a href="https://fortunly.com/statistics/blockchain-statistics/#gref" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">over 90% of US and European banks</a> had started to explore blockchain&#8217;s potential. And that was just the start. Today blockchain technology is being applied in various industries, including supply chain, finance, real estate, and many others. Blockchain technology is no longer limited to cryptocurrencies but is being used to build dApps, Defi platforms, NFTs, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A decentralized application (dApp) is a network-based application that isn’t centrally governed and combines a smart contract and a frontend user interface. Numerous blockchain platforms are available that enable the smooth and rapid development of dApps and other use cases. Tezos is one such open-source multi-purpose blockchain platform supported by a global community of researchers, builders, and validators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tezos solves the<strong> issues surrounding the adoption of blockchain technology</strong> for assets and applications. It was created to <strong>provide the required safety and code correctness</strong> for assets and other high-value use cases to the protocol and its application layers. It addresses several<strong> blockchain adoption barriers such as open participation, long-term upgradability, and smart contract safety</strong>. The network&#8217;s modular architecture and upgraded mechanism enable it to implement new technological innovations as they emerge.</p>



<p>Let’s discuss the Tezos coin before we tell you how to buy Tezos crypto and things you need to know before buying Tezos cryptocurrency.</p>



<h2>What is Tezos (XTZ)?</h2>



<p>The creation of Tezos was proposed in 2014 by Arthur Breitman and Kathleen Breitman under the pseudonym LM Goodman. The proposed Tezos protocol addressed one of the major shortcomings of blockchain technology at the time, namely &#8220;fork-based governance.&#8221; In 2017, the Tezos Foundation launched one of the most popular fundraisers <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2017/07/13/232-million-tezos-blockchain-project-finishes-record-setting-token-sale/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">and managed to accumulate a record-setting $232 million</a> to support the development of the proposed protocol outlined in the Tezos white paper in 2014.</p>



<p>In 2018, the network finally launched with the intention to establish a stronger and more institutionalized presence in the crypto market. As a result, its native cryptocurrency XTZ came into existence. There are mechanisms built into the Tezos platform to ensure active community governance and participation. Tezos crypto holders can actively participate in the Tezos network by evaluating, proposing, or approving changes. This design encourages collaborative innovation that keeps Tezos at the forefront of technology.</p>



<p>In the words of Arthur Breitman,</p>



<p><em>&#8220;What we&#8217;re trying to bring, in some sense, is a rule of law that is, OK, if we have to have these changes because the network needs to evolve, at least we need to have a clear, decentralized procedure for making those changes.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Tezos claims that its blockchain is the <strong>first &#8220;self amending&#8221; blockchain</strong> globally. It means that Tezos coin or XTZ holders can vote on-chain to propose any changes in the network without the need for in-person discussions as required in off-chain governance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Further,<strong> Tezos smart contracts can use formal verification, making them mathematically verifiable, dependable, and secure</strong>. Due to this reason, Tezos smart contracts are built to be suitable for financial agreements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In August 2021, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/08/24/swiss-financial-trio-to-offer-institutions-tokenized-assets-on-tezos/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Incore Bank, IT firm Inacta, and crypto trading firm Crypto Finance AG announced</a> that they would use Tezos’ DAR-1 token standard to create regulated financial products. In addition, Incore Bank announced the launch of institutional grade storage, staking and trading services for the Tezos network.</p>



<p>The Tezos blockchain can be divided into the following parts:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Shell</strong> – The code that is responsible for interpreting transactions and administrative operations. It can also amend itself based on user voting.</li><li><strong>Protocol </strong>– The code in charge of sending proposals to the shell for approval.</li></ul>



<h2>How does Tezos (XTZ) Work?</h2>



<p>Tezos uses a variant of classic proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus known as liquid PoS (LPoS). LPoS is an algorithm that &#8211; like traditional PoS mechanisms &#8211; is used by computers running the Tezos software to secure the network, validate transactions, and distribute newly minted XTZ.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Participants (&#8220;nodes&#8221;) must stake Tezos token or XTZ to participate in governance. This process is called &#8220;baking.&#8221; A node requires 8,000 XTZ to become a baker (also called a roll). A user can also delegate his Tezos token to other bakers. This means they are allocating their votes to the bakers to earn a share of the bakers&#8217; XTZ rewards on the live blockchain in return. Bakers of Tezos are similar to miners of Bitcoin. Delegating XTZ does not involve the actual transfer of assets. Therefore, users can keep their tokens and change the bakers to whom they delegate at any time.</p>



<p>Bakers participate in blockchain governance by voting on proposed code changes. The voting process is divided into the following four distinct voting periods, each roughly 23 days apart:</p>



<ul><li>The Proposal Period</li><li>The Exploration Vote Period</li><li>The Testing Period</li><li>The Promotion Vote Period</li></ul>



<p>When token holders bake or delegate their tokens, they earn rewards proportional to their share of all tokens and retain their share of the total token supply. Holders&#8217; shares of the total supply are diluted over time as new tokens are minted via baking rewards when they do not bake or delegate. As a result, Tezos inflation is &#8220;non-dilutive inflation,&#8221; as holders can easily avoid dilution by baking or delegating.</p>

<p>Grid trading is considered one of the most common crypto trading tactics among those who do not wish to trade manually. However, it is pretty simple to automate and can provide substantial returns under the right market circumstances. In this article, let&#8217;s learn more about this idea.</p>



<h2>What is Grid Trading?</h2>



<p>Grid <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/understanding-the-wazirx-trading-report-is-easier-now/" data-wpel-link="internal">trading</a> is one of the type of trading that involves putting in a series of purchase and sell orders around a predetermined price at regular intervals. In this way, a commerce grid is formed.</p>



<p>Grid trading performs best in a competitive market with frequent price changes. By automatically executing low buy orders that result in high sell orders, it ensures profitability each time the selling price exceeds the purchase price during a lateral price movement, nullifying the requirement for market forecasting.</p>



<h2>Working of a grid trading</h2>



<p>For instance, a trader may set a lower limit of $59,000 and an upper limit of $61,000 if the price of Bitcoin (BTC) is $60,000. Their &#8220;grid&#8221; is the region that lies between these two limitations. A purchase order is carried out when the price reaches $59,000, and a sell order is carried out when it reaches $61,000. Traders can set several buys and sell orders at various locations in their grids.</p>



<p>A trader must manually choose one lower limit and one upper limit for each grid trade. The trading bot automatically executes these orders at predetermined price intervals. They can set as many more orders as they like, but they must have at least one purchase order and one sell order inside the grid.</p>



<p>The potential for profit increases with the size of the difference between the lower and upper limits. For instance, if a trader places a purchase order at $60,000 and a sell order at $65,000, the trader will make more money when the upper limit is set to $61,000.</p>



<h2>Advantages of grid trading</h2>



<p>Grid trading is well-liked among crypto traders because it can be automated and enables traders to make money in sideways markets. Grid trading has several advantages, including:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Automation</strong></li></ul>



<p>After manually establishing trade limits, such as grid buy/sell orders, trading bots execute transactions on your behalf. As a result, trading bots operate around the clock, and traders can gain profit without personally monitoring price fluctuations.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Profitability in sideways markets</strong></li></ul>



<p>Grid trading enables traders to make money when there is no evident trend in the market. This strategy takes advantage of the sideways price movements that frequently occur for months at a time in the crypto market.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Grid density options</strong></li></ul>



<p>A trader can specify many automated buy/sell limit orders. As a result, they can decrease their risk and increase their chances of profit.</p>



<h2>Tips for grid trading</h2>



<p>Deciding on a reasonable pricing range is key to making sure your plan is profitable. This suggests that you must be highly selective about the appropriate market circumstances for your approach to prevent being on the wrong side of a trending market.</p>



<p>You must make sure that the appropriate risk management measures are in play. Therefore, to prevent losses brought on by market swings, you must choose a proper leverage ratio and create suitable take-profit and <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-stop-loss-in-crypto-trading/" data-wpel-link="internal">stop-loss orders</a>. For instance, if a sell order is put, a stop loss should be above the top of the price range, and if a purchase order is placed, it should be below the bottom of the price range.</p>



<p>Finally, ensure that the grid trading criteria you choose are appropriate for the current market circumstances. In range-bound markets, limit orders made outside the range are less likely to be filled, resulting in missed opportunities. The grid trading criteria can be changed in real-time to reflect the current state of the market.</p>



<h2>Final thoughts</h2>



<p>Grid trading is fully controlled by code and is unaffected by human emotions. By comprehending market dynamics, grid trading will place orders at prices that gradually rise and fall in an effort to profit from market volatility. As a result of the market&#8217;s price discrepancy, individual investors will benefit.</p>



<p>The strategy works best when there are minimal price changes and a sideways market. This method may be highly beneficial if a trader stays updated on the news and changes the layout of their grid every day.</p>

<p>Blockchain technology has taken the digital world by storm and is slowly percolating into real-world businesses and enterprises. However, issues like security and scalability prevent blockchain technology&#8217;s adoption on a mass scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While decentralization, immutability, and transparency are inherent characteristics of every blockchain, each of them serves a unique purpose. For instance, Bitcoin offers the best in class security on its blockchain. However, it suffers from high scalability and speed issues. On the other hand, Ethereum is the largest network for dApps and smart contracts-based applications. But Ethereum&#8217;s blockchain suffers from high gas fees and low transaction throughput. In November 2021, the <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/ethereum-transaction-gas-fees-high-solana-avalanche-cardano-crypto-blockchain-2021-12" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">average gas fee on the Ethereum network</a> hit a whopping $63.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What if we tell you there&#8217;s one blockchain that brings the best of both worlds and supersedes the obstacles faced by both ETH and BTC? Kadena has come up with a unique solution to solve these issues and bring together distinct utilities in the current blockchain networks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kadena is a public blockchain platform that provides users with a one-of-a-kind blend of scalability and security. Yes, Kadena brings together the security of the Bitcoin network and the programmability of Ethereum to create a more scalable, secure, and developer-friendly blockchain. Kadena offers its users marginal to zero transaction processing fees. Further, Kadena has introduced <a href="https://blockchainmagazine.net/kadena-implements-first-crypto-gas-station-on-blockchain/#:~:text=by%20creating%20gas-,Kadena%2C%20a%20network%20that%20combines%20public%20applications%20with%20private%20blockchains,medium%20channel%20on%20August%206." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">the first crypto gas station</a> on its blockchain. This allows businesses to eliminate all transaction fees for their customers, removing a major barrier to dApp mass adoption.</p>



<p>This article will take you through the complete guide on how to buy Kadena in India and everything you need to know before buying the Kadena cryptocurrency.</p>



<h2>What is Kadena (KDA)?</h2>



<p>Stuart Popejoy and Will Martino founded the Kadena network in 2016. The network was found with the sole purpose of providing businesses with a scalable and efficient service. Stuart Popejoy previously led JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.&#8217;s blockchain group, and Will Martino served as the SEC&#8217;s crypto steering committee&#8217;s tech lead.</p>



<p>Kadena is a Layer-1 network that uses Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus with a new smart contract language, &#8220;Pact,&#8221; that allows formal verification and upgradeable smart contracts. Pact is a human-readable smart contract language. According to Will Martino, <em>&#8220;Lawyers with Microsoft Excel programming skills can use Pact to write contracts and publish them on the blockchain.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Pact is believed to be the safest smart contract language for developers to write directly on the blockchain. Moreover, it also simplifies transactional logic by combining authorization, data management, and workflow functions. Kadena&#8217;s unique architecture eliminates the need for any Layer-2 scalability functionality or external solutions needed by market leaders like Ethereum. As Will Martino explained in an interview after Kadena’s launch,</p>



<p><em>&#8220;The key here, with this launch, is that for the first time ever, we figured out how to have a scaled proof of work network. We figured out how to shard proof of work.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>KDA is the native cryptocurrency of the Kadena ecosystem. Like Ethereum, miners are compensated for mining blocks on the network using the KDA coins as rewards. The transaction fee users pay to have their transactions included in a block is also paid using KDA coins.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, KDA has a market capitalization of $286.72 million and ranks at 100. The total supply of KDA coins is fixed at 1 billion that are aimed to be mined over a span of more than 120 years. Miners will receive <a href="https://medium.com/kadena-io/the-kadena-token-economic-model-8090d7545eef" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">70% of the total KDA supply</a>. The platform&#8217;s share is 20% of the total KDA supply. The remaining 7% and 3% of the total Kadena cryptocurrency supply are allocated to investors and contributors.</p>



<h2>How does Kadena (KDA) work?</h2>



<p>As mentioned earlier, KDA is the native cryptocurrency of Kadena. Kadena&#8217;s public blockchain network is known as ChainWeb. Developers on Kadena have brought together the blocks and hashes between multiple chains together to create ChainWeb. ChainWeb is a new parallel-chain Proof-of-Work (PoW) architecture comprised of braided blockchains. On braided blockchains, if one blockchain can perform x transactions, then two blockchains can perform 2x transactions, three can perform 3x transactions, and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ChainWeb&#8217;s braided chains mine the same native cryptocurrency, KDA. These braided chains can transfer liquidity between each other and provide extremely high throughput without increasing the network&#8217;s overall hash power. ChainWeb has the potential to <a href="https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/chainweb-and-the-art-of-scalable-blockchains-ed0c9ff03ab3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">operate across over 1,000 blockchains</a>. Each such chain is capable of processing up to 10,000 transactions per second. Therefore, even with increasing demand, the energy use on Kadena remains the same, making the network more energy-efficient than others.</p>



<p>Further, Kadena uses a unique combination of programmable smart contracts and Bitcoin’s Simple Payment Verification capability (SPV). This allows the users to verify individual transactions without the need to process the entire blockchain. Kadena also uses a sharded architecture to provide developers with nearly infinite storage capacity. On Kadena&#8217;s sharded network, developers are given access to virtually limitless expandability, storage, and upgradeability. Moreover, Marmalade, built on the Kadena blockchain, provides a platform to launch and run NFT marketplaces with 100% on-chain transactions, high-quality provenance, low gas fees, and shared ownership.</p>

<p>To buy USDT, you can use the WazirX P2P route. This is fast, secure, and free. Follow these simple steps to buy USDT and then your Kadena crypto:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Log in to your WazirX account on the web/mobile app and select “P2P” from the &#8220;exchange&#8221; option.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<ol start="2"><li>Next, click on the ‘Convert INR into USDT’ option.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<ol start="3"><li>Add the INR price at which you want to purchase USDT. Next, add the number of USDT tokens you want to purchase and click on “BUY”. However, the minimum purchase should be 14.5 USDT.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>Once you click on the buy button, WazirX will match you with sellers. However, if you wish to purchase the USDT from a specific seller, you can add the XID of that person and complete the transaction.</p>



<ol start="4"><li>You need to select a preferred mode of payment next. UPI and IMPS mode are the two options available. Please note that IMPS linking is mandatory on the WazirX platform; however, UPI linking is optional.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<ol start="5"><li>Once you confirm and click on the message “YES, I WILL PAY’, you will get 60 additional minutes to complete your payment. In case of non-payment, after confirmation, a minimum penalty of 10 USDT or 1.2% of trade value will be levied. False confirmations can also cause your account to get locked.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<ol start="6"><li>Complete the payment as per the payment details on the screen (seller&#8217;s bank/UPI details). Once the payment is complete, upload the payment proof and click on the checkbox “I HAVE PAID”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>Once the seller confirms the receipt of payment, your order will be marked complete, and the USDT purchase will be reflected in your “funds”.&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="7"><li>Now you can use this newly acquired USDT balance to purchase Kadena crypto on WazirX exchange. Go to the “exchange” option on the web/mobile app and select Kadena crypto from the list of the tokens available in the USDT market. &nbsp;All price charts, order book data, and an order input form are visible on the right side of the screen.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>Fill out the buy order form and click on buy Kadena. Wait for some time. It will only be a short while before your order is executed. Once it&#8217;s done, you will receive the Kadena coins you purchased in your WazirX wallet.</p>

<p>Beginning in the Stone Age, the progression of human history up to the era of digitalization has been remarkable. It has become abundantly clear that community contributions are of the utmost significance throughout history. Since the dawn of time, people have had an innate need to be community members to increase their ability to cooperate and improve the quality of their work.</p>



<p>The increasingly digitalized world has shown that the power of community still reigns supreme, but to an even greater extent and with more strength than in the past. The community around Dogecoin is the most precise illustration of this. <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-dogecoin-how-to-buy-dogecoin-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">Dogecoin</a> has shown the world the importance of community involvement and participation. Because of the support it received from its community, Dogecoin was able to thrive in the very competitive cryptocurrency market and earn a spot among the top 10 biggest cryptocurrencies.</p>



<h2>What exactly is a community?</h2>



<p>Community is a shared experience that pulls people together. It is not a society or any other type of organization. It&#8217;s a group of people&#8217;s trust.</p>



<p>The community has fostered an environment in which its members feel a sense of belonging, safety, care, and trust for one another. The community possesses the power to affect society and bring about fundamental changes in the world. The idea of community refers to an event or activity that brings together individuals with a common interest.</p>



<h2>Cryptocurrency Community</h2>



<p>When we talk about cryptocurrencies, the community is paramount. It provides a sturdy basis upon which cryptocurrencies may be built. In a nutshell, the project&#8217;s community serves as the driving force behind it.</p>



<p>A community may be defined as any group of individuals who have aims and interests in conjunction with one another. People with similar beliefs, a passion for cryptocurrencies, and a desire to see them succeed as an asset class makes up one component of the cryptocurrency community.</p>



<p>Most cryptocurrency user communities are active on social media websites and apps, including Twitter, Discord, Telegram, Slack, and Viber. The community around cryptocurrencies is consistently one of the most engaged and committed groups across all forms and varieties of social media.</p>



<h2>The Significance of the Cryptocurrency Community</h2>



<p>Because cell phones and internet connectivity are now so widely available, people all over the globe have unrestricted access to the many social media sites out there. The introduction of <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/impact-of-blockchain-technology-on-leadership-and-management/" data-wpel-link="internal">blockchain technology</a> and cryptocurrencies has altered how we see the world. Because of this, many new possibilities have been available to individuals all around the globe. It is generally agreed that the internet was the most significant innovation of the modern period and that blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are close runners-up. If cryptocurrencies are at the cutting edge of technology, then the cryptocurrency community is the engine that propels the technology forward.</p>



<p><strong>A community around a cryptocurrency project plays a crucial part in the following:</strong></p>



<ul><li>The process of making decisions and developing cryptographic protocols.</li></ul>



<ul><li>It contributes to the development of support networks.</li></ul>



<ul><li>It is helpful in the process of disseminating cryptocurrencies.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The general populace is becoming more informed about the initiative with the community&#8217;s assistance.</li></ul>



<ul><li>It extends the sphere of influence of the project.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The project&#8217;s success is directly correlated to the level of community participation it receives.</li></ul>



<h2>How Should One Go About Analyzing a Cryptocurrency Community?</h2>



<p>The strength of the cryptocurrency community is the primary factor that will decide how quickly the cryptocurrency market expands. A project needs to have a community that is dedicated, honest, and focused, that also has an understanding of the community&#8217;s fundamental ideas. A significant portion of the world&#8217;s activity has moved online in recent years, and the development of an active community is one of the most critical steps in bringing bitcoin into the digital sphere.</p>



<p>On the many different social media platforms, there is a multitude of communities to join. Additionally, it is essential to have a solid understanding of which communities are valuable and productive. Communities have an enormously significant role in deciding the scalability of cryptocurrencies. First and foremost, if you want to become a better trader in cryptocurrencies, you need to educate yourself on how to analyze crypto communities.</p>



<p>It is not a difficult undertaking to analyze a crypto community; all you need is an understanding of some of the key building blocks that make up a community.</p>



<h2>Let&#8217;s take a look at some of the ways in which you might analyze a cryptocurrency community:</h2>



<p>Building a vibrant and expanding community is analogous to building a foundation since each community member serves as a support beam for the project&#8217;s overall design. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to keep a watchful eye on the community to determine whether or not it is connecting with the community members. There are numerous groups on the internet whose members seldom engage with one another and solely publish material. Participation in these communities is entirely optional and not required in any way.</p>



<p>It is recommended that you look for a community that is actively participating in meaningful conversation. This indicates that community people are participating in debates about the projects, their potential future consequences, as well as the advantages and drawbacks of the initiatives. Always stay away from online forums where the sole topic of conversation is how to make money buying and selling assets.</p>



<p>In most of the cases, people are more likely to follow a community that already has a sizable number of adherents. However, it is not always reasonable to justify a significant following. The community must be well informed about its project, constantly working to improve it, and is focused on imparting knowledge.</p>



<p>Analyze the community about its competitors to establish its level of strength. You need to evaluate its growth pace, the number of followers, and whether most followers are organic or simply a few confirmed bots. Investigate the flow of information in the chat rooms. Investigate the core of the message, and steer clear of the community if the core is just &#8220;we&#8217;re going to change the market, world, crypto space, etc.&#8221;</p>



<p>Before you can make any judgments on the value of the conversation, you need to find out if it is a one-way or a two-way conversation first. Does the community have a proper understanding of both sides of the argument? Are the people in this community genuinely trying to convey the initiative&#8217;s importance and how it would revolutionize the market? Is the community open to constructive criticism, and does it make use of feedback?</p>



<p>How the community reacts to queries is one of the most significant elements to take into consideration. Is there an openness to fresh suggestions within the community? If members of the community consistently repeat phrases such as &#8220;trust the team&#8221; and &#8220;believe us,&#8221; you may want to examine the tenor of the discussion. It shouldn&#8217;t always have an authoritative tone.</p>



<p>Investigate the community to see whether or not it is functional. Is the community only seeming to care about helping other people, or are they doing it because they want to appear more authoritative? The community around Dogecoin is the most notable illustration of this phenomenon. There are several instances of the Dogecoin community helping others, such as assisting a Natwest driver in raising cash for the race or helping a squad of athletes fulfill their expenditures for the Olympics. Both of these are excellent instances of the Dogecoin community doing good. The Dogecoin community is widely considered among the most influential online communities and has significantly contributed to various humanitarian causes. As stated by several industry professionals, the Dogecoin community is reportedly one of the most charitable in the cryptocurrency world.</p>



<p>Understanding how the community responds when faced with hardship is crucial. Because the passage of time is not always on a community&#8217;s side, the manner in which it deals with challenging circumstances is the single most vital aspect that defines how thriving the community will be. In addition, it is equally important to ascertain if the community is working towards the project&#8217;s development or merely aims to capitalize on the excitement.</p>



<p>Investigate the community to see whether it is encouraging long-term investments or a scam that involves pumping and dumping. Unfortunately, there are several forums online that are focused mainly on the pump and dump tactics at the moment to capitalize on the euphoria around cryptocurrencies. Avoid such communities.</p>



<p>You should check out the Twitter sites of Lunar Crush and Moby, as they will be able to aid you in delivering true and legitimate information on cryptocurrencies and <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/10-lgbtq-nft-artists-to-support-in-pride-month-and-beyond/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFT</a>. In addition, you may use these sites to check the information that has been contributed by the community as well.</p>



<p>There is no getting around the undeniable truth that the bitcoin community plays a crucial part in the industry. The development of cryptocurrencies also relies on communities since thriving communities are essential to the success of a project. As more people use social media platforms, it is becoming simpler for individuals to join existing groups. Digital communities are an excellent tool for fostering equality among their participants while contributing to the project&#8217;s overall evolution.</p>



<h2>Summing Up</h2>



<p>The cryptocurrency community is the driving force behind the success of any given cryptocurrency project. For example, Dogecoin has shown the world the importance of community by reaching over 1.7 million users on Reddit.</p>



<p>When assessing the worth of a cryptocurrency venture, the community acts as the first contract that must be satisfied. Communities have the ability to either build or scrap a project. To gain fruitful outcomes from an investment in a project, it is essential first to identify and evaluate the community that will be affected by the endeavor.</p>

<p>As we are halfway through 2022, being a crypto enthusiast, you must be aware that the crypto market has faced some significant downfalls and crashes. On a positive note, let’s hope things get better or stay stable. All you need to do is HODL harder and not lose hope; we already know how volatile is the crypto market.</p>



<p>We are back with a list of the top crypto to invest in in July 2022.</p>



<p>Being in the crypto industry, you know how intriguing this crypto-verse is getting day by day, you can see new cryptocurrencies launching frequently, and they are unique in their own ways. As an investor, whether you are a newbie or a seasoned one, you may get overwhelmed with the characteristic features of these coins coming up in the market.</p>



<p>If you want to diversify your portfolio and include cryptocurrencies that have some unique purposes, you should consider reading the following list of cryptocurrencies to buy in July 2022.</p>



<h2>#1 Bitcoin (BTC)</h2>



<p>As a <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/5-must-know-tips-as-a-newbie-crypto-investors-5-mistakes-to-avoid/" data-wpel-link="internal">newbie crypto investor</a>, when you look at the top crypto to invest in in July 2022, Bitcoin (BTC) should be on your list. Today, no matter what the market conditions are, BTC is the most prominent crypto asset when it comes to market capitalization.</p>



<p>In the first few months of 2022, Bitcoin was stuck between the price levels of approximately $18,000 &#8211; $22,000 in terms of price and valuation. However, according to experts and their price predictions, BTC can reach above $75,000 by the end of 2022. So, if you want to buy and hold crypto for the long term, Bitcoin is your answer.</p>



<h2>#2 Ethereum (ETH)</h2>



<p>Looking for the best cryptocurrency to buy in July 2022? Ethereum is always the safest option, whether you are new to crypto investments or an experienced one. Today, most crypto projects are built on the Ethereum blockchain. In addition, most of the meme coins and metaverse projects launching today use the Ethereum blockchain, so when it comes to finding the top crypto to invest in in July 2022, Ethereum should be the default answer.</p>



<p>Launched in 2016 with an initial price of $10 and reaching an all-time high of $3,550 in 2021, Ethereum has the potential to be a good investment option for you in the long term.</p>



<h2>#3 ApeCoin (APE)</h2>



<p>Looking at another top crypto to invest in in July 2022 is ApeCoin (APE). This meme coin was recently launched in 2022 by the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC). The platform has over 10,000 unique Bored Ape collectibles in the form of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This coin is considered one of the best altcoins to purchase as it is based on the Ethereum blockchain technology.</p>



<p>After the launch, the prices of the APE coin went up to $42 per token. Initially, the ApeCoin project was developed as a Metaverse crypto project. It allows crypto traders and investors to make online purchases through Shopping.io. In addition, the users get access to products from eBay, HomeDepot, Amazon, and Walmart.</p>



<p>You can consider this popular meme coin to diversify your portfolio this July.</p>



<h2>#4 DogeCoin (DOGE)</h2>



<p>For potential gains in 2022, DogeCoin (DOGE) can be considered as best cryptocurrency to buy in July. DogeCoin gained popularity last year because Elon Musk often tweeted about it, and due to this, the meme coin gained huge returns.</p>



<p>DogeCoin has been in the top 20 list of the most popular cryptocurrencies globally. According to industry experts, the price prediction of DogeCoin is estimated to go beyond $1 by the end of December 2022. Buying the DOGE token will let you enter the market at a considerable discount, which means you buy DOGE today at a price that is almost 82% lower than its predicted rate.</p>



<h2>#5 Solana (SOL)</h2>



<p>The next cryptocurrency to buy in July 2022 should be Solana (SOL). Solana is an open-source project that uses decentralized blockchain technology that allows the deployment of smart contract agreements. Solana project was started five years ago but was officially launched in March 2020.</p>



<p>Solana is considered one of the hottest cryptocurrencies, continually making new all-time highs and gaining traction globally. According to its price predictions, the SOL coin is expected to rise by over almost 450% in 2022 and can reach above $450 per token.</p>



<h2>#6 Cardano (ADA)</h2>



<p>Another top crypto to invest in in July 2022 is Cardano (ADA). It is a popular, fast-growing blockchain technology that is secure and sustainable. In addition, this platform employs a <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-whats-better/" data-wpel-link="internal">Proof-of-Stake (PoS) </a>algorithm to achieve consensus. As a result, it is considered a more scalable network when compared to Proof-of-Work (PoW) chains.</p>



<p>Its native token ADA has gained popularity as one of the increasing numbers of PoS blockchains under construction in the crypto ecosystem. The Cardano project is a third-generation blockchain system that supports smart contracts with potential uses in supply chain management and quality control.</p>



<p>Experts suggest that this coin will bloom in the coming time. This is because the digitization of money will significantly impact the market; hence it’s evident that coins like Cardano (ADA) will only rise up and above.</p>



<h2>Closing words</h2>



<p>With new cryptocurrencies being launched in the market every now and then, we keep you updated on the top crypto to invest in every month.

<p>Cryptocurrencies are, by nature, mysterious, as it&#8217;s right there in the name. Additionally, if you go by Warren Buffett&#8217;s recommendation to never invest in businesses, you don&#8217;t understand that it could be difficult to justify investing in a currency composed of math rather than gold.</p>



<p>However, specific cryptocurrencies&#8217; astonishing performance is equally difficult to ignore: From just under $5,000 in March 2020 to more than $60,000 in April 2021, the cost of one <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/the-next-bitcoin-halving-when-what-and-how/" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a> increased dramatically.</p>



<p>The enthusiasm around digital currency may leave some investors feeling like the lonely kid at the pool party, wanting to join their pals in the deep end but too afraid to dive in.</p>



<p>For those investors who are very interested in doing so and believe it to be a dangerous endeavor, we have compiled a list of ways to reduce the risk of crypto investments. Read this article carefully!</p>



<h2>#1 Invest buffer money</h2>



<p>Given all the talk about volatility, it should be clear that you cannot invest all your funds in crypto. Therefore, if you decide to invest in cryptocurrencies, be sure to have buffer money. This money should be extra money that you don&#8217;t require to meet your basic necessities. It&#8217;s never a good idea to obtain money to invest in crypto. Instead, experts suggest investing a small sum over a long time for the best results. You don&#8217;t have to invest a large sum of money at once; you may expand it with additional resources available.</p>



<h2>#2 Investing in companies with Crypto holdings</h2>



<p>If you are unsure about investing directly in crypto, you might consider investing in businesses that have crypto holdings. The companies would then act as a bridge between you and crypto volatility. The extent of risk depends on the quantity of crypto the business holds on its balance sheet. Look at its balance sheet to find out more about the business&#8217;s cryptocurrency holdings. For example, the value of Tesla&#8217;s Bitcoin holdings was $1.99 billion as of December 31, 2021. If the value of Bitcoin rises, this will automatically cause Tesla&#8217;s stock price to rise.</p>



<h2>#3 Investing through index funds</h2>



<p>Another option to invest in a crypto is by using index funds. An index fund simply means a portfolio of stocks that are created to closely resemble the composition of an index of the financial markets. The foundation of these funds is on the idea that over the long run, the market will perform better than any investment. You can utilize index funds to invest in cryptocurrencies, much as investments in conventional financial markets. For example, cryptocurrency index funds like Crypto10 and Crypto20 expose purchasers to the top 10 and top 20 cryptocurrencies, respectively, based on market capitalization.</p>



<h2>#4 Copy-trading</h2>



<p>In this approach, you copy the crypto investments of experienced traders. You can easily duplicate their trades on multiple crypto trading platforms. First, you must select a crypto trader based on their track record, the number of followers, and the degree of risk involved in their trades. After you choose a crypto trader based on these criteria, you can link your account to that trader&#8217;s account so that it will automatically purchase and sell the same assets as the trader.</p>



<h2>#5 Investing in Crypto platforms</h2>



<p>You can also invest in crypto by staking money on cryptocurrency infrastructure. This means you choose companies that are actively engaged in cryptocurrency. This includes mining firms and cryptocurrency trading platforms. In addition, there are various crypto trading platforms and blockchain developers on whom you can rely.</p>



<h2>#6 Hedging</h2>



<p>You can hedge your bets if you are unclear about the way you believe the asset will head in. <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/bitcoin-and-inflation-why-is-the-premiere-cryptocurrency-a-hedge/" data-wpel-link="internal">Hedging</a> means using a primary trade in the way you anticipate the market to move and a secondary trade in the opposite direction. Whether the asset&#8217;s value increases or decreases, hedging will save you from losing money.</p>



<p>Crypto investors can hedge their investments by going long or short in the futures market. Going long is an approach where you decide to purchase a cryptocurrency at today&#8217;s prices at a specific future date because you anticipate its value to increase. On the other hand, going short is an approach where you commit to selling a coin at the current price at a specific point in the future if you believe its value will decrease.</p>



<h2>Bottom line</h2>



<p>Finally, doing extensive market research is one of the most crucial things you can do to lower risk while investing in crypto. Avoid making your investment choices based on hype (remember the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/the-reality-of-squid-games-crypto/" data-wpel-link="internal">Squid Game</a> Token fraud?). By taking the time to research the asset, you wish to purchase and make sure you are not investing all your funds in crypto. This will guarantee the slightest loss in case the asset values decline at some time in the future.</p>

<p>Today, the vast majority of cryptocurrencies on the market rely on open public blockchains to validate and store transactional data. As a result, anybody can access the data &#8220;on-chain&#8221; at any time and location.</p>



<p>The on-chain analysis is the process of determining market sentiment by analyzing data from a blockchain ledger. Specifically, it entails looking at transaction data and crypto wallet balances, which are important in determining whether or not to invest. After all, it is safe to assume that an investment in a token is not a wise idea if it is not traded and the great bulk of its circulating supply is owned by a small number of big holders, known as whales.</p>



<p>Utilizing the vast amounts of data made available by public blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum may provide a fresh viewpoint that is not available with conventional assets, and it can supplement the findings of other analyses.</p>



<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll delve deeper into what on-chain analysis is all about and try to comprehend how it can benefit cryptocurrency investors.</p>



<h2>What is an On-chain Analysis?</h2>



<p>An on-chain analysis technique uses data from public blockchains to help traders improve their crypto trading tactics.</p>



<p>All of the major transactions that take place on a particular public blockchain network are typically included in the on-chain data. Transaction information includes the sender and receiver addresses, the value of the transaction, the transaction fee, and the remaining funds at a particular address. In addition, timestamps, miners&#8217; fee rewards, and smart contract codes are also in this block data.</p>



<h2>History of On-chain analysis</h2>



<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s on-chain analysis can be traced back to the creation of coin days destroyed in 2011, which was the first indicator to leverage age as a metric for valuing the currency.</p>



<p>The Network Value to Transaction (NVT) ratio, popularized by CoinMetrics, Chris Burniske, and Jack Tatar, was one of the first commonly used on-chain measures for cryptocurrencies. In addition, there is an NVT ratio, which was developed in the summer of 2017 to measure the utility value of a cryptocurrency, especially its transactional utility.</p>



<p>We can tell whether a cryptocurrency is overpriced by comparing its network value to the number of transactions recorded on the blockchain. The NVT ratio is high when the number of transactions doesn&#8217;t justify the network&#8217;s value. Conversely, if the network value is extremely low, it may signal that a more significant price is warranted when considering the transaction volume. The Price-Earnings ratio is sometimes used to compare the NVT ratio to stocks, and the two ratios may also be used to determine if a coin is an excellent investment to purchase, hold, or sell.</p>



<p>It didn&#8217;t take long until the NVT ratio was updated. Others improved the statistic to reflect better the economic activities taking place on the blockchain, allowing for a more accurate evaluation of network value.</p>



<p>For instance, the Network Value to Transaction ratio Signal, also known as NVTS, was created by measuring the moving average of transaction volume over the course of 90 days. In addition, CoinMetrics has recently improved the ratio by considering the free float supply while doing their calculations. For example, these incremental steps show how a cryptocurrency&#8217;s underlying value might evolve over time.</p>



<p>On-chain metrics have evolved from the discontent with simple indicators from technical analysis (such as volume) and other notions adopted from conventional markets like market capitalization, such as price/volume. Many cryptocurrency comparison websites utilize market capitalization as a ranking factor.</p>



<p>Because cryptocurrencies are more like money or commodities than corporate stock, market capitalization is an inaccurate and misleading metric. Market capitalization levels may be subverted using various techniques of issuance — For example, suppose a project has 1 trillion tokens in circulation, and a few of them sell for $1, the market cap is $1 trillion, even though the currency may only trade a few hundred dollars worth of units.</p>



<p>Traders are using a new set of techniques to better understand the health of blockchain networks because of the weaknesses of market capitalization and the risks of applying standard measures to cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>It is possible to trace how long a wallet has kept its funds using the concept of UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs) in Bitcoin. As a result of this, on-chain indicators such as realized capitalization, HODL waves, and the proportion of supply in profit/loss have been developed to offer reliable signals.</p>



<p>As an alternative to using market capitalization to analyze coins, realized capitalization has arisen as a means to leverage blockchain data to do so without any of the drawbacks. The recognized capitalization algorithm, developed by Nic Carter and Antoine Le Calvez, assigns a value to each UTXO depending on the last time it was transferred.</p>



<p>In October 2018, Mahmud Marov and David Puell created the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, which builds on the realized capitalization statistic. An oscillator, the MVRV ratio, indicates if bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued by respecting certain thresholds in the past. MVRV z-score, long-term holder to short-term holder MVRV ratio, and account-based blockchains like Ethereum are all metric variations.</p>



<p>Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain network, varies from Bitcoin and several altcoins because it is built on an account model rather than a UTXO model. A UTXO tracks each coin&#8217;s journey to a final address; the ledger records who owns what and when, and the addresses may include several UTXOs.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the account model makes it more challenging to determine the age of individual currencies like Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens since incoming and outgoing coins are mingled in account balances. Ethereum and other account-based cryptocurrencies are not immediately comparable to metrics used in Bitcoin (and other blockchains like Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin). Further effort is required to carry these models across from UTXO-based cryptocurrencies.</p>



<h2>How does on-chain analysis work?</h2>



<p>An asset&#8217;s HODL status, its market capitalization, and its future prospects are all criteria that may be used for on-chain research.</p>



<p><strong>Market Capitalization</strong></p>



<p>A cryptocurrency&#8217;s value is determined by its market capitalization. To calculate the overall worth of a network, you multiply the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price by the total supply. In addition to calculating the network&#8217;s net value, we can also use market capitalization to assess the crypto asset&#8217;s market size, adoption, and risks.</p>



<p><strong>Hold Status</strong></p>



<p>Analysts utilize a statistic known as the HODL wave to assess the current market trend. If traders are HODLing or swiftly dumping an asset, then the HODL wave alerts analysts. In addition, it influences the market&#8217;s sentiment and the HODLers&#8217; outlook, i.e., whether they believe the price will fall or climb.</p>



<p>Using coin concentration metrics, it is also possible to identify the concentration of &#8220;whales&#8221; and significant investors in the network. For example, if a few addresses own a substantial proportion of a token, the whales and large-scale investors may influence the market by dumping tokens. Therefore, it&#8217;s necessary to analyze the concentration of large token holders to minimize cryptocurrency investment risks.</p>



<p><strong>Future Prospects of a Cryptocurrency</strong></p>



<p>You may look at a crypto asset&#8217;s future open interest to see whether or not investors are becoming more engaged in it in the long run. These include the connection between a token&#8217;s price and Bitcoin&#8217;s and the overall volume of trades.</p>



<p>Investing in cryptocurrencies that are more intimately correlated to Bitcoin price drops might help investors reduce their exposure to risk by tying the value of their token or altcoin to the price of Bitcoin. At the same time, it may serve as a warning indicator for high-net-worth individuals and large institutions by indicating when specific tokens or currencies are coming into or going out of circulation on a particular exchange.</p>



<h2>How to Use On-chain Analysis for Crypto?</h2>



<p>It is possible for on-chain analysts to build more accurate pictures of the crypto market based on solid facts and a fundamentals-driven approach than on hype, thanks to cryptocurrency and blockchain data&#8217;s transparency.</p>



<p><strong>Predict future market movements</strong></p>



<p>On-chain analysis helps traders improve their tactics and better forecast future market moves by monitoring investor behavior and network health in real-time. Crypto traders, for example, may forecast whether or not interest in a specific cryptocurrency will increase or diminish by considering the number of active addresses and the number of transactions. The price of a cryptocurrency often rises in tandem with an increase in the number of active addresses and transactions.</p>



<p><strong>Study investor behaviors</strong></p>



<p>In addition, on-chain data might provide information about specific investment habits. On-chain analysts, for example, may look at how long an address has been holding a cryptocurrency and how many people are HODLing the coin. It&#8217;s possible that as the number of people HODLing the cryptocurrency grows, so does its supply. On the other hand, if demand remains steady, on-chain research suggests that the price of that coin will rise. As a bonus, it demonstrates faith in the asset&#8217;s long-term success as well.</p>



<h2>What are the drawbacks of using on-chain analysis?</h2>



<p>On-chain analysis, despite its potential, is still in its infancy. Given the lack of historical data, its application may develop, or new patterns may be identified that lead to the establishment of new metrics as the sector evolves.</p>



<p>When comparing the on-chain parameters of different crypto-assets, careful consideration is needed. This is because not all blockchains are created equal; for example, Bitcoin is focused on the aim of digital gold, while Ethereum&#8217;s blockchain is utilized for a wider variety of applications. Nevertheless, if on-chain metrics are improving, this is a positive sign in general.</p>



<p>The following are a few limitations of on-chain analysis:</p>



<ul><li>Only a decade&#8217;s worth of Bitcoin history may be used to support historical analysis (and even less data for more recently launched crypto-assets). It is possible that specific measurements may lose their validity over time or that their interpretation may alter in light of conflicting data.</li></ul>



<ul><li>On-chain throughput metrics may be distorted by layer 2 scaling solutions like the Lightning Network, sidechains for BTC, Plasma, and zkRollups for Ethereum, which might change the way transaction volume is measured. The way these metrics are interpreted may evolve in response to shifts in on-chain activities.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The on-chain analysis may not be helpful for scalpers and short-term traders since these indicators are more useful for longer-term market cycles. However, short-term traders may profit from more detailed data that may be accessed by operating their complete node or by mixing on-chain insights with order book data and technical analysis. For example, order book data may be compared to on-chain positions to identify critical support and resistance zones. Technical signals may also be utilized to execute a trade based on blockchain analysis.</li></ul>



<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>



<p>The on-chain analysis is similar to studying a company&#8217;s fundamentals to have a better understanding of its value and usefulness. Rather than relying on traditional financial statements to assess the health of a company, on-chain analysis of digital assets uses data from transaction logs, chain metrics, and wallets. While still in its infancy, the enormous volume of publicly accessible data on crypto-assets makes it a particularly attractive application of data science and machine learning.</p>

<p>The line has halted, and it&#8217;s not going to rise anytime soon.</p>



<p>The all-time highs of cryptocurrencies in 2021 now seem like a fading memory, and significant digital assets have lost value following the 2022 crypto crash, which ended their legendary bull run.</p>



<p>So, why is crypto falling? First, it&#8217;s crucial to remember that crypto assets are not the only ones in this most recent cycle. Additionally, there has been a downtrend in the stock market.</p>



<p>However, crypto has been impacted particularly hard since investors have been moving away from riskier assets. Additionally, institutions and other major participants in the space that made investments close to the market&#8217;s peak are under pressure due to the decrease in cryptocurrency prices.</p>



<p>Investing in crypto has never been for the fearful. Digital assets are <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/will-crypto-markets-get-less-volatile/" data-wpel-link="internal">highly volatile</a>, and such fluctuations have already occurred in the past.</p>



<p>FUD, or fear, uncertainty, and doubt, is a term used by people to represent the negative sentiment that has been spread in the crypto community. Although these emotions might aid in spotting warning signs, it&#8217;s crucial to maintain composure and consider how short-term instability can impact your long-term objectives.</p>



<p>What then happens when digital currencies like Bitcoin crash? First, let&#8217;s understand how investors can respond to a downturn in the crypto market.</p>



<h1>5 Ways to deal with Crypto market crash</h1>



<h2>1. Maintain a long-term perspective.</h2>



<p>Investments in cryptocurrencies are highly volatile. On the chart for 2021, you can already observe several large price drops. However, cryptocurrency values have risen after each fall and continue to climb high.</p>



<p>Avoid concentrating on the 24-hour charts. Zoom out instead and consider the entire year. All types of market cycles have their ups and downs, but they are more dramatic with a new and somewhat untested investment like crypto. You can expect to wait out the dips if you haven&#8217;t made the short-term investment you need.</p>



<h2>2. Don&#8217;t panic-sell.</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s natural to want to sell your assets when you watch the price of your crypto investments fall. However, this frequently results in you selling at a low and missing out on any subsequent recovery.</p>



<p>Imagine that you decide to sell your Bitcoin holdings after it drops by 20%. What would happen if the cost suddenly increased to its previous level? Since you lost 20% of your investment, you might be hesitant to buy it back.</p>



<p>You can never really predict how prices will behave in a short period. They could keep falling, but they might also abruptly shoot upwards. Therefore, have faith in your original research and investing concept. Be assured that the price will increase if you think your crypto investment will be valuable in the long run.</p>



<h2>3. Consider purchasing the dip.</h2>



<p>Although it&#8217;s often said that you should purchase at lows and sell at highs, it isn&#8217;t easy to time the market in this way.</p>



<p>Significant drops in price, however, can provide you the chance to buy more of your preferred tokens for a discount. For example, you could have some tokens on your watchlist that you&#8217;ve been waiting to purchase. Alternatively, if you believe that specific tokens you already possess have excellent long-term potential, you might wish to purchase more of them.</p>



<p>Having said that, avoid the pitfall of panic buying as well. It serves no purpose to purchase an asset you haven&#8217;t thoroughly investigated and don&#8217;t desire just because it&#8217;s on sale. And it&#8217;s definitely not a brilliant idea to borrow money (or worse, spend the money you need to fulfill other financial goals) to purchase the dip.</p>



<p>Since there are still a lot of unknowns in the world of cryptocurrency investing, they are still prone to volatility. If you attempt to purchase the dip, prices can decline even further.</p>



<h2>4. Analyze the causes of the market&#8217;s decline.</h2>



<p>Understanding why prices are declining is a good thing in case it affects your initial investment notion.</p>



<p>For instance, suppose you invested in crypto because you believe that the particular blockchain technology would change a specific sector of the economy. However, the price of the technology began to decline o n speculations that the advances in quantum computing have made that technology obsolete. If such rumors are accurate, it could be time to reconsider your investment because your original justification might no longer be valid.</p>



<h2>5. Make sure crypto makes up a minimal portion of your overall portfolio.</h2>



<p>Finally, these unexpected price drops serve as a helpful reminder that investing in crypto is quite risky. Making money might seem simple when prices are rising. But every form of investment requires time and effort — and prices just don&#8217;t go up, always.</p>



<p>You can reduce the risk by just including crypto in a tiny portion of your entire portfolio. Instead, balance your risk exposure by retaining a healthy proportion in items like stocks, ETFs, and real estate, as many other investment alternatives are available. This will prevent financial catastrophe if the present dip signals the start of a bigger crash.</p>



<h2>Final thoughts</h2>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/things-to-do-when-the-crypto-market-crashes/" data-wpel-link="internal">Crashing</a> cryptocurrency prices are unavoidable in this kind of investing. The best piece of advice is to hold on tight and hope for prices to rise if this is your first dip. You could then decide that investing in crypto can be too stressful for you, which is understandable. But avoid making hasty judgments. Before you begin selling, give yourself and the market some room to breathe. Happy trading!</p>

<p>With conventional savings rates hovering around rock bottom, it&#8217;s no surprise that cryptocurrencies and related concepts like staking, yield farming, and crypto lending are receiving a lot of interest. Few would argue against the appeal of passive income.</p>



<p>The term Annual Percentage Yield (APY) is widely used in both conventional banking and the cryptocurrency industry to describe the rate of return on investments. The primary distinction is whether or not your returns are compounded, i.e., whether or not your earnings generate earnings. Therefore, the Annual Percentage Yield (APY) is a crucial indicator for comparing returns across various platforms and assets if you&#8217;re a crypto investor.</p>



<p>This article explains APY, how it works in cryptocurrency, and where it matters when making investments.</p>



<h2>What is APY?</h2>



<p>The Annual Percentage Yield (APY) of an investment takes into account the compound interest, which is interest earned over time. Compound interest is when interest is added to an interest that has already been earned.</p>



<p>While Annual Percentage Yield (APY) is often associated with &#8220;old school&#8221; savings accounts, it is nevertheless a crucial metric for crypto-based financial products. APY may be earned on cryptocurrencies by staking them, depositing them in savings accounts, or providing liquidity to liquidity pools via yield farming.</p>



<p>You can quickly earn APY on your crypto by using cryptocurrency exchanges, wallets, and DeFi. <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/tradfi-vs-defi/" data-wpel-link="internal">Decentralized Finance</a> (DeFi) incorporates the decentralized concept of blockchain into the realm of finance.</p>



<p>Most of the time, investors will receive interest in the same cryptocurrency they invested in. However, they may be compensated in a different currency in other cases.</p>



<h2>APY vs. Simple Interest: A Comparison</h2>



<p>A simple interest rate includes the interest earned on the initial investment. However, an APY is the expected yearly return on a deposit or investment after compound interest is deducted. Thus, the primary distinction is that APY takes into account the effects of compounding interest if it applies.</p>



<p>Compounding is a good investment approach since it helps you to earn more money over time. Compound interest is calculated over a specific time period and applied to the balance. Then, with each subsequent month, the interest is paid on the total amount climbs.</p>



<p>To make it simpler to understand, consider staking $1,000 at a 12% annual interest rate in January 2021. Using a simple interest rate calculation, you will receive a total of $1,000 (1 + 12 %) = $1,120 in January 2022 after one year.</p>



<p>The same $1,000 invested at 12% per year with biannual compounding returns of $1,060 after six months.</p>



<p>You will have earned $1,060 (1+ 6%) = $1,123.60 after a year.</p>



<p>The additional $3.60 is due to the power of compound interest. Your annualized percentage yield in this example is 12.36% (1.1233610001).</p>



<h2>How Does Crypto 7-Day APY Work?</h2>



<p>The 7-day APY is the annualized yield based on 7-day returns. It&#8217;s calculated by converting the 7-day net price difference into an annual percentage.</p>



<p>Calculating 7-day APY:</p>



<p>APY = 365/7 (X Y Z)</p>



<p>Where:</p>



<p>X denotes the 7-day price.</p>



<p>Y indicates the price at the start of the seven-day period.</p>



<p>Z indicates weekly exchange fees.</p>



<p>This approximate value helps investors in gauging the weekly yield or return.</p>



<h2>How to Calculate APY in Cryptocurrency?</h2>



<p>The APY formula is as follows:</p>



<p>APY = (1 + r/n)ⁿ − 1</p>



<p>Where:</p>



<p>r stands for return on investment (or annual APR)</p>



<p>N is the number of compounding periods in a year.</p>



<p>The calculation to determine APY in crypto is the same as it is in conventional finance, with the intention of providing a percentage return.</p>



<p>However, depending on the exchanges, there are numerous methods to compute APY. The APY is calculated in the form of simple interest. Based on the number of tokens deposited, the daily yield shows the interest rate that will be sent into your wallet.</p>



<p>The formula is given below:</p>



<p>Daily yield = The number of total tokens staked × (APY for the staked token ÷ 365)</p>



<p>For example, if you staked 10,000 USDT for a guaranteed APY of 9%, you will get a rounded-off to the nearest integer of 2.5 USDT the next day. The formula is as follows: 10,000 (0.09 365) = 2.4657 USDT</p>



<p>No yield will be added to your account if you opt to unstake your tokens after receiving the daily rewards. In effect, any changes to the original staked asset will have an impact on the daily yield.</p>



<h2>Best platforms for earning APY on Crypto</h2>



<p>Unsustainably high APY in crypto of 1000% or more may signal fraud or a crypto enterprise desperate to attract investors. On the contrary, there are secure, dependable platforms where you can earn up to 17% APY on cryptocurrency, which is significantly superior to savings account at your bank.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s look at some of the most popular names in this market:</p>



<h2>DeFi Swap</h2>



<p>DeFi Swap is a fresh new <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/can-decentralized-exchanges-dex-become-mainstream/" data-wpel-link="internal">Decentralized Exchange</a> (DEX) located on the Binance Smart Chain that allows investors to easily swap tokens, stake coins, and farm yields. DeFi Coin (DEFC), a BEP-20 token that generated triple-digit gains when the exchange went online, powers the DeFi Swap ecosystem.</p>



<p>DeFi Swap, being one of the top DeFi exchanges, provides a simple option for investors to earn a return on their idle crypto assets. Through DeFi Swap&#8217;s autonomous liquidity pools, which offer the financial resources to support token swaps, investors may generate a consistent revenue stream. In addition, transactions can be performed in a cost-effective and decentralized way thanks to DeFi Swap&#8217;s use of these liquidity pools rather than conventional order books.</p>



<p>The particular APY given by DeFi Swap&#8217;s liquidity pools is determined by the tier you choose. At the moment, four tiers are available:</p>



<p>Bronze: 30-day lockup, 30% APY</p>



<p>Silver: 90-day lockup, 45% APY</p>



<p>Gold: 180-day lockup, 60% APY</p>



<p>Platinum: 365-day lockup, 75% APY</p>



<p>These rates are far higher than a typical bank account, making DeFi Swap one of the best DeFi platforms for yield generation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking forward, the future of DeFi Swap (and DeFi Coin) is bright. Upgrades to the DeFi Swap exchange, including webinars and real-time market data, are already in the works. Finally, storing DEFC in your wallet will let you participate in the token&#8217;s built-in taxation system, which will increase your revenue even more.</p>



<h2>AQRU</h2>



<p>AQRU seeks to make earning interest on your cryptocurrency assets easy and flexible. You may earn APY on Bitcoin, stablecoins, or both with no lockup period or fixed terms.</p>



<p>The APY for BTC and ETH offered by the platform is 7%, while the APY for stablecoins USDT, USDC, and DAI is 12%.</p>



<p>Deposits may be made via bank transfer, debit or credit card, or by transferring cryptocurrency to an AQRU wallet. AQRU is also a cryptocurrency lending platform that offers loans backed by customers&#8217; cryptocurrency holdings to businesses like exchanges and individual borrowers.</p>



<p>Interest is paid every day, so your crypto savings balance earns compound interest. Funds are available for withdrawal at any moment, and fiat withdrawals are free. The withdrawal charge for cryptocurrency is $20.</p>



<p>The minimum deposit to earn APY on AQRU is $100. However, if the value of BTC or ETH falls after depositing, you will still receive APY.</p>



<h2>Bitstamp</h2>



<p>Bitstamp has a rewards program called Bitstamp Earn, through which users may earn interest on their cryptocurrency holdings at a rate of 4.45% on Ethereum 2.0 or 5% APY on ALGO (Algorand tokens). Unfortunately, APR is a basic interest rate that does not compound. This is because ETH 2.0 has not yet been completely deployed.</p>



<p>Bitstamp is a crypto staking platform; thus, your assets are not distributed as crypto loans but instead utilized to verify and validate blocks on the blockchain, resulting in staking rewards. You don&#8217;t need to actively participate since Bitstamp provides the nodes and other technological tools needed to stake crypto.</p>



<p>The APY is deposited immediately into your account. Algorand staking incentives are distributed quarterly after each governance term.</p>



<p>Staking awards for ETH 2.0 are awarded at the start of each calendar month. However, due to the way Ethereum staking works, you will only be able to liquidate your ETH2 after the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade is implemented. The same is true for ETH staking on other cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>



<p>These three are just some of the most popular platforms as of now. However, with some research, you&#8217;ll find several more such platforms, each with its APY offerings. But, always do thorough research about the platform before investing any funds.</p>



<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>



<p>Every prudent investor must have a system for evaluating various investment options and keeping track of their returns. APY, or Annual Percentage Yield, is a typical return computation rate used in conventional banking and cryptocurrency. It takes into account the benefits of compound interest, which may enhance the amount earned. The greater the APY, the greater the profit for investors. To determine which investment opportunity offers the highest APY, comparing the many available choices is helpful.</p>

<p>There is no opposing the fact that the DeFi industry is rising. Since the summer of 2020, called the &#8221;DeFi summer,&#8221; the total value locked in multiple protocols has been growing. At the same time, volume on <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/can-decentralized-exchanges-dex-become-mainstream/" data-wpel-link="internal">Decentralized Exchanges </a>(DEXs) and Automated Market Makers (AMM) has also been rapidly rising.</p>



<p>However, the number of attacks in the DeFi sector has significantly risen due to this.</p>



<p>Even though every protocol carries some apparent risks, with the right amount of research, blatant frauds, exploits, and rug pulls can be avoided.</p>



<p>In light of this, we have put up a list of precautions you may take to protect yourself from DeFi scams.</p>



<h2>Common DeFi scams</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Hacks and Exploits</strong></li></ul>



<p>Without question, this is something to be aware of. But unfortunately, the DeFi space is a haven for skilled hackers who analyze different protocols for any potential loopholes they use to their advantage and steal as much money as possible.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Exit Scams</strong></li></ul>



<p>Exit scams are another thing to be on the lookout for. They occur when the team behind a particular project vanishes, taking the investors&#8217; money along with them and going completely unnoticed.</p>



<p>These frauds most frequently occur during the early funding rounds. For instance, a project can promote a private sale in which investors can receive a terrific deal before their tokens are made available to the general public. Unfortunately, there are instances where the project is never completed because the team pulls an &#8220;exit scam&#8221; and escapes with the money raised from initial investors.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Rug Pulls</strong></li></ul>



<p>These could also be categorized as exit scams. They are different, though; in this, the company doesn&#8217;t keep the money that users put into a presale round; instead, they offer the token on a decentralized exchange and wait for enough individuals to sign up to add liquidity to the pool.</p>



<p>The team would &#8220;pull&#8221; the liquidity out of the DEX and aggregate everyone&#8217;s stake in it after they had accumulated enough individuals and money, respectively.</p>



<h2>6 Ways to save yourself from DeFi scams</h2>



<p>Even in traditional finance, <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/5-cryptocurrency-scams-and-how-to-deal-with-them/" data-wpel-link="internal">scams</a> are common and are closely monitored by both federal and legal authorities. However, this is particularly true in the DeFi sector. Money is being thrown into every available and new crypto project. Bad guys lurk around every corner in a town without a sheriff, hoping to capitalize on your fear of missing out. Here are some simple ways to keep your bacon safe if you&#8217;re new to the world of altcoins:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Do not click on links in emails.</strong></li></ol>



<p>Visit the website the email appears to originate from using your browser. Verify the URL yet again. Assess whether this email makes sense. Did you actually attempt to log into one of your crypto accounts and fail? Or did you get an email requesting you to change your password out of the blue?</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Enable additional security measures.</strong></li></ol>



<p>Decide to use extra security protections if your wallet or exchange platform supports them. When you try to log in, you may activate 2-step verifications, which can send email or text codes to your inbox or phone. Next, enable biometrics that requires your fingerprint to launch the app if you trade using mobile applications. And finally, if possible, add a unique anti-phishing password to your crypto accounts. Emails from specific accounts or platforms will reflect the code you created within the email, letting you know they are valid.</p>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Always be suspicious.</strong></li></ol>



<p>Just assume that everyone is attempting to mislead you on social media. Be critical when interacting in direct messages, comment sections, or discussion forums. Never give someone your money, coins, or crypto credentials. Make unique emails and robust passwords for each of your crypto accounts. Never do crypto trade using your regular personal email.</p>



<ol start="4"><li><strong>Cross-check the URL.</strong></li></ol>



<p>If you use crypto to make online purchases of products or services, double-check the website address to be sure you are dealing with a real business and not a fake website created to steal your personal data. Verify that the business name is spelled correctly. Scammers frequently replace letters with numbers that seem like letters, such as an &#8220;l&#8221; for a &#8220;1.&#8221; Verify that the &#8220;s&#8221; or a forward slash is present in the URL address (&#8220;https://&#8221;).</p>



<ol start="5"><li><strong>Buy a cold wallet.</strong></li></ol>



<p>Keep your crypto in a &#8220;cold&#8221; wallet, which is a physical device like a USB that holds your coins offline if you are not actively trading. There are a lot of brands from which you can purchase cold wallets. Always purchase them straight through their websites, and never from any 3rd party online stores.</p>



<ol start="6"><li><strong>Do your own research, always!</strong></li></ol>



<p>Always conduct extensive due diligence and research. Make sure you are familiar with the developers, the source of the project&#8217;s funding, and the validity of the use case before investing in any crypto. But be aware of the risks as well. Although you have examined the project, you can still lose everything. Despite the fact that this coin appears to be genuine, are you willing to lose money on it? If not, turn around.</p>

<p>Whales, the largest creature on earth, have a unique analogization in the crypto world. However, in the crypto space, the term &#8220;crypto whale&#8221; is somewhat arbitrary and refers to people who own a significant portion of a cryptocurrency&#8217;s supply. Small-cap whales, for instance, might only hold $1 million of it, as opposed to $BTC or $ETH whales, who typically control at least a few billion dollars&#8217; worths.</p>



<p>They frequently manipulate markets to accumulate more money while dumping it on &#8220;shrimps.&#8221; Shrimps are people who hold a lesser market share, primarily small-time investors or traders. So, are we just destined to follow whales&#8217; whims? First, let&#8217;s look at who are whales, why tracking whale wallets is essential, and how to track the wallets.</p>



<h2>Who are whales?</h2>



<p>According to coincarp, a crypto whale is a person or business that owns a significant quantity of a particular cryptocurrency. A whale with sufficient cryptocurrency holdings has the power to control the value of a coin or token. In general, there is no set amount of tokens or coins that an individual or organization must have to qualify as a whale. If you have 1000 Bitcoin, some people could think you&#8217;re a whale. The figure will be larger for altcoins, as it is essentially correlated with market value.</p>



<h2>Why Should we track them?</h2>



<p>Since the markets are cyclical, bear and bull markets may begin in opposite directions. Retail money typically drives market price increases at their peaks, but investing is best done when the market price is down. Even while all retail investors are responsible for the price movement, crypto whales play a significant role in shaping market trends. We can learn about the trading habits of crypto whales and determine the market stage by tracking their whereabouts. Assuming that whales cut their holdings as prices rise, we can conclude that the market has peaked, especially because retail investors continue to add to their positions simultaneously.</p>



<p>Furthermore, market price movement and market liquidity are always associated. Crypto whales can manipulate the supply of cryptocurrencies to affect the market&#8217;s liquidity and cause volatility. The whales&#8217; goal is to drive up the value of their digital assets. Thus, they might sell a lot of tokens to spark a larger market sell-off before purchasing them again at a discount. Additionally, they have the option of releasing a sizable amount of assets to buy cryptocurrency, which will increase the value of their holdings by driving up the price of the cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency whales significantly impact the market price; therefore, investors want to monitor their activity and profit if the whales&#8217; movement occurs.</p>



<h2>What are Whale Wallet Transactions?</h2>



<p>There is no shortage of technical indicators and price patterns you can use while trading cryptocurrencies to increase your profits. These popular crypto trading techniques include moving averages, Bollinger bands, bull flags, and support and resistance levels. The issue is that institutional investors frequently predict what everyone else is going to do and take profits in advance when everyone is utilizing the same indicators. Hence, utilizing on-chain analysis is one of the simplest methods to differentiate your research from other investors. And whale wallet tracking is one of the most potent on-chain analyses. But, first, we must comprehend the different types of transactions that can take place to track whale wallets.</p>



<p>These consist of:</p>



<ul><li>Exchange to Wallet: Transferring money from a cold wallet to exchange is known as &#8220;exchange to the wallet.&#8221; In general, currency outflows result in higher prices and vice versa.</li><li>Wallet to Exchange: Fast investments between a hot wallet and exchange. Depositing assets typically signals sell pressure while depositing stablecoins suggests buying pressure.</li><li>Wallet to Wallet: Denotes OTC (over-the-counter) transactions, usually for liquidity and privacy. These transactions occasionally occur merely to cause market reactions, but generally, they do not significantly impact the market.</li></ul>



<h2>How to Track Whale Wallet Transactions?</h2>



<h3>1. <strong>Tracking Whale Movements</strong></h3>



<p>A whale movement is a significant bitcoin exchange. Depending on the direction of the transaction, it&#8217;s a straightforward signal that can hugely impact the price of a cryptocurrency. Whale Alert is a Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">ac</a><a href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">c</a><a href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">ount</a> which had come to become one of the best ways to keep up with whale movement. It notifies followers about large transactions.</p>



<h3><strong>2. Market Depth</strong></h3>



<p>Market depth reveals how much capital is necessary to raise or lower a coin&#8217;s price on a specific cryptocurrency exchange. The depth of the crypto market is measured by how much money is required to raise or lower the cost. On CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap, you can quickly verify a coin&#8217;s market depth under the Markets tab. Market depth is crucial when analyzing how a whale movement may affect the price.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, the price impact could be minimal if you notice a movement of 10 million dollars worth of ETH from a wallet to an exchange with a market depth of 20 or 30 million dollars to the downside. However, most altcoins have millions or even less in market depths. Therefore, a $10 million whale movement would significantly impact the pricing in other altcoins.</p>



<h3><strong>3. Using Blockchain Explorers</strong></h3>



<p>On blockchain explorers like Etherscan, if you notice that a cryptocurrency is being transmitted from a regular wallet to an exchange wallet, it is likely that the sender wishes to sell the cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the transaction is small, this is not a huge concern. However, the price could drop if you witness the transfer of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of a cryptocurrency from a wallet to an exchange. On the other hand, if you notice that a wallet is receiving hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin from an exchange, that wallet&#8217;s owner likely plans to HODL.</p>



<p>Etherscan is one of the most dependable and well-known block explorers for Ethereum. Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/a-comprehensive-guide-to-using-etherscan/" data-wpel-link="internal">guide to</a><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/a-comprehensive-guide-to-using-etherscan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"> </a><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/a-comprehensive-guide-to-using-etherscan/" data-wpel-link="internal">using Etherscan</a>. </p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Whales ultimately desire a rise in the value of their currency. However, most of the time, others suffer, as a result, falling prey to their market-moving waves. One effective strategy to stop this is to monitor their wallets and comprehend their motivations.</p>



<p>Tracking cryptocurrency whales might help you better comprehend market trends and patterns. Investors shouldn&#8217;t, however, just rely on these techniques and make snap judgments based on the whales. Tracking whales may provide some advantages, but it is not the most reliable information because the cryptocurrency market is unregulated and hence more easily manipulated than traditional financial markets. Therefore, before making trading judgments, you should <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/top-10-crypto-research-tools-investors-should-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">DYOR</a>!</p>

<p>With the &#8220;Merge,&#8221; the Ethereum blockchain&#8217;s existing Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism will be replaced by the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus model, which is anticipated to be faster and more energy-efficient. However, shifting the second-largest blockchain from one system to another is a challenging and multi-step procedure. Therefore, it&#8217;s crucial to consider each step carefully.</p>



<p>In this blog, let&#8217;s get an overview of this Ethereum &#8220;Merge.&#8221;</p>



<h2>What is Ethereum 2.0 &#8220;Merge&#8221;?</h2>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-does-the-future-of-ethereum-hold-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum 2.0</a> is the next iteration of the Ethereum blockchain that will employ a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism instead of Proof-of-Work (PoW) to validate transactions through staking.</p>



<p>Ethereum 2.0&#8217;s staking mechanism will replace the Proof-of-Work (PoW) paradigm in which cryptocurrency miners employ powerful computers to accomplish complex mathematical operations known as hashes. Instead, the mining process uses a high amount of electricity to validate the Ethereum transactions before recording them on the public blockchain.</p>



<p>Proof-of-Work (PoW) system consumes a lot of power. For instance, the annualized energy consumption of bitcoin mining is presently 127 terawatt-hours (TWh). Thankfully, Merge is anticipated to cut Ethereum&#8217;s carbon footprint by up to 99.95%, resolving one of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s primary concerns.</p>



<h2>Ethereum vs. Ethereum 2.0: What will happen after the &#8220;Merge&#8221;?</h2>



<p>Since April 2022, Ethereum has operated on two parallel blockchains: a test chain that uses Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and the main chain that uses Proof-of-Work (PoW). With the &#8220;Merge,&#8221; the old Ethereum Mainnet blockchain (ETH1) and the brand-new Beacon Chain (ETH2) will be combined into a single, integrated blockchain.</p>



<p>Ethereum developers recently dropped the ETH1 and ETH2 terminology because it may confuse the users ahead of the Merge.</p>



<p>Some crypto investors may have been confused by what seems to be the two versions of Ether, that is, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum Network, on well-known cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>



<p>Users stake their Ether on crypto exchanges, which convert it from ETH to ETH2, with the exact pricing for both coins. These two forms of Ether will be merged into a single token once the process is finished.</p>



<h2>What will be the impact of the Ethereum &#8220;Merge&#8221;?</h2>



<p>According to some experts, the upgrade might help Ethereum expand again after other blockchain initiatives reduced its market share in the previous six months.</p>



<p>Some crypto experts predict that the markets will respond favorably to the Merge later this year. That&#8217;s because the Ethereum merge will enhance security and stability, speed up processing, and reduce Ethereum&#8217;s energy use by 98% or more.</p>



<p>Crypto researchers claim that connected altcoins may also see price hikes with this update. The initiatives that are constructed on top of Ethereum, such as Polygon, Arbitrum, and many more, will see favorable momentum. Meanwhile, the Ethereum ecosystem may exert extra pressure on rival protocols like Solana and Polkadot since the update will let the network expand, lower transaction costs, and increase interest in blockchain technology.</p>



<h2>How will Ethereum update?</h2>



<p>Ethereum is in its first stage of transition to what it calls the Beacon Chain, which uses the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-whats-better/" data-wpel-link="internal">Proof-of-Stake (PoS)</a> consensus mechanism.</p>



<p>When they were launched, Bitcoin and Ethereum employed a method called &#8220;Proof-of-Work (PoW)&#8221; to validate each blockchain transaction. A systematic procedure adds transactions to the blockchain, or digital record, in blocks. However, the Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism demands a lot of computational power since it requires all computer networks to agree and create new blocks.</p>



<p>By having network users stake crypto as collateral to testify for the new blocks added to the chain rather than having computers do it, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) models reduce this level of energy utilization. Proof-of-Stake (PoS) methods in crypto allow the ecosystems to circulate crypto in the same way that we circulate fiat dollars, much like banks need pools of their customers&#8217; money to turn around and lend money out. Since the crypto has already been minted once, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) models need less time and effort to vouch for new blockchain transactions than Proof-of-Work (PoW) models.</p>



<h2>What will happen after the &#8220;Merge&#8221;?</h2>



<p>Merge&#8217;s main objective is to accelerate the transition from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Therefore, developers are attempting to remove features that might slow down the transfer to temporarily prevent users from withdrawing staked ETH after the Merge is complete. However, they will probably be fixed in a &#8220;cleanup&#8221; upgrade that comes after the Merge.</p>



<p><strong>Shard chains:</strong></p>



<p>Although the Merge won&#8217;t instantly address scalability issues, it will assist in getting the network ready for Ethereum&#8217;s version of subsidiary shard chains, which will require a fully operational PoS network to function. Shard chains offer less expensive layers for apps and rollups to store data by distributing the network&#8217;s data load among 64 blockchains. They also make it possible for layer 2 systems to provide minimal transaction costs while gaining the advantages of the Ethereum Mainnet&#8217;s security.</p>

To know more about this, read on.]]></description>

<p>Many people learned about DAOs for the first time when one of them tried to raise $50 million to buy a copy of the Constitution.</p>



<p>While that initiative failed, it did raise awareness of a sort of blockchain-based communal governance that has spread like wildfire in the last year or so, infecting everything from charitable fundraising and political lobbying to sports investment and art collecting.</p>



<p>More recently, the UkraineDAO, which was just a few days old, raised over $3.3 million for the Ukrainian war effort by auctioning off a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) of the country&#8217;s flag. However, this is only a portion of the $53 million raised by AssangeDAO in the past months to finance legal attempts to liberate Wikileaks founder Julian Assange from a UK prison. Big Green DAO, a food-and-nutrition-focused nonprofit owned by Elon Musk&#8217;s brother, is also decentralizing how donations are allocated.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, PleasrDAO, a Chinese art investment firm, recently paid $4 million for the single copy of Wu-Tang Clan&#8217;s record &#8220;Once Upon a Time in Shaolin.&#8221; FriesDAO just hired a former Domino&#8217;s Pizza executive to help build a community-run fast-food franchise empire.</p>



<p>The DAO is at the epicenter of the decentralized finance (DeFi) revolution.</p>



<p>Almost all DeFi initiatives are or will be run by DAOs. The fundamentals of a DAO are simple and clear: Sell cryptocurrency tokens that include a vote on how the funds raised are used by the entity in charge. Because voting is governed by self-executing smart contracts, there is no need for centralized administration to guide the organization.</p>



<p>But that&#8217;s not the end of the story. DAOs have also ventured into the market of investing with a new name &#8211; Investment DAOs. Investment DAOs are groups of crypto-wealthy investors that pool their resources to fund companies or to make investments, with the group&#8217;s governance rights being enforced through smart contracts.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s take a close look.</p>



<h2>What is an Investment DAO?</h2>



<p>Investment DAOs use the potential of Web3 to democratize and expand the investment process.</p>



<p>DAOs can issue tokens that are listed on a cryptocurrency market. Governance is enforced using smart contracts. Voting rights can be divided up based on how much a person owns in the DAO.</p>



<p>Traditional investment vehicles work in different ways than decentralized organizations that invest in cryptocurrencies, real estate, Non &#8211; Fungible Tokens (NFTs), or any other asset class. This is especially true when the underlying investment opportunity is a cryptocurrency firm.</p>



<p>However, how does this differ from typical venture capital (VC)?</p>



<p>Before delving into the distinctions between regular venture capital and investment DAOs, let us first examine how traditional venture capital works.</p>



<h2>Venture Capital Fund &#8211; Centralized Fundraising</h2>



<p>Venture capital funds are created and managed by general partners (GPs). GPs research investment opportunities, undertake due diligence, and close portfolio investments.</p>



<p>Venture capital is part of the capital pyramid that invests cash from pension funds and endowments into portfolio enterprises. Limited partners (LPs) are major institutions, family offices, and certain individuals who invest in VC funds.</p>



<p>GPs must obtain funds from LPs, discover high-quality firms, do detailed and proper research, and deploy capital profitably. As startups grow and give returns to VCs, the VCs pass those rewards on to LPs.</p>



<p>Traditional venture funding has fueled the growth of the internet, social media, and Web2 titans for three decades. However, it is not without its flaws, which the Web3 model aims to resolve.</p>



<h3>Centralized</h3>



<p>Even if participation as an LP is exclusive, investment choices are often determined by a limited number of persons who sit on the VC fund&#8217;s investment committee. As a result, the majority of investment choices are extremely centralized.</p>



<p>This can be a barrier not just to global investment but also to identifying hyperlocal possibilities in the world&#8217;s final mile. A centralized team can only do so much in terms of sourcing (of investment deals) and global deployment capabilities.</p>



<h3>Illiquid</h3>



<p>Another major difficulty with traditional venture capital is that it is an illiquid asset type. Capital invested in these vehicles is frequently locked in for years. Only when the VC fund makes an exit, such as when a portfolio firm is purchased or goes public, do the LPs get part of their money returned.</p>



<p>LPs continue to engage in venture capital because the returns are often higher than those of more liquid assets such as bonds and publicly traded stocks.</p>



<h3>Exclusive</h3>



<p>The venture capital model is not as broad as it could be. Because of the amount of capital needed and the asset class&#8217;s risk profile, it is frequently only sustainable for skilled investors.</p>



<p>It is essential that investors understand the risk-reward profile of their assets. As a result, venture capital may not be suitable for all retail investors. However, some segments of the retail investor population are smart enough to participate in this asset class. However, even skilled retail investors find it challenging to become limited partners in venture capital funds.</p>



<p>This is due to the fact that experienced GPs are sometimes difficult to approach for regular investors or because the minimum investment into these funds is several million dollars.</p>



<p>This is where investment DAOs step in.</p>



<p>DAOs combine the Web3 ethos with the operational scalability of smart contracts. Investors that agree on a specific investing thesis might band together to create a fund. Investors can contribute to the DAO in differing proportions based on their risk tolerance, and their governance (voting) rights are allocated based on their contributions.</p>



<h2>So how are Investment DAOs changing the game?</h2>



<h3>Inclusive access</h3>



<p>Accredited investors can invest any amount through Investment DAOs. These investors have the ability to vote on crucial investment choices as a result of their contributions. Therefore, both the procedures of investing in the DAO and selecting portfolio assets are more inclusive.</p>



<p>Like governance, deal sourcing may be decentralized. Just imagine you&#8217;re in charge of a global fund that invests in technological solutions for coffee producers. Having members from Nicaragua to Indonesia in the group undoubtedly helps in locating the finest last-mile investment possibilities. This enables investment vehicles to be more specialized and globalized while being relatively local.</p>



<p>Because these DAOs may be tokenized, investors can make smaller contributions. This allows them to diversify their risks by selecting from a basket of funds in which they can invest. Furthermore, with a few exceptions, DAOs are more open to taking investments from all across the world than traditional venture capital.</p>



<p>Consider a $100,000 accredited retail investor seeking exposure to subclusters of Web3 and crypto companies. To distribute their investment over all these different DAOs, the investor can select an investment DAO specialized in NFTs, decentralized finance, layer-1 cryptocurrencies, and so on.</p>



<h3>Investments are Liquid</h3>



<p>LPs in traditional venture capital cannot liquidate their stakes in the fund before the fund offers an exit. DAOs with tokenized investments address this issue. Investment DAOs may have a token whose value is derived from the underlying portfolio. Investors who possess these tokens can sell them on a cryptocurrency exchange at any moment.</p>



<p>By providing this feature, investment DAOs provide comparable returns to traditional VCs, although with lower liquidity risk. Based on the risk-return profile, this makes DAOs a superior investment vehicle.</p>



<p>However, despite all the added perks that stem from Investment DAOs, there are some risks.</p>



<h2>Risks with DAOs</h2>



<p>For example, because crypto investments are anonymous, it is sometimes hard to ascertain the investor&#8217;s intellect. This makes it more difficult to shield investors from taking high risks with a volatile asset. Regulators are attempting to solve this issue by regulating how a DAO promotes itself in order to attract investors.</p>



<p>There are other challenges in establishing a DAO in which the legal language is programmatically placed into smart contracts. These investment structures are frequently handcrafted by massive legal teams in traditional markets. Using smart contracts to accomplish this efficiently involves both a legal and technological risk.</p>



<p>However, there are some projects that are working on bridging this legal gap between Web3 and the real world.</p>



<h2>Closing Note</h2>



<p>The development of investment DAOs is still in its early stages. Despite this, there is potential in the model. Investment DAOs have the potential to become the paradigm that typical venture capitalists adopt once the legal and regulatory problems have been overcome.</p>

<p>A crypto wallet plays a crucial role for users who want to interact with Web3 applications. Additionally, crypto wallets serve as entry points for users to use decentralized apps (dApps) on Ethereum-based blockchains. However, various blockchain wallets are present nowadays; programmers find it difficult to support these wallets in their dApps due to the programming requirements. This is where WalletConnect comes into the scene.</p>



<p>WalletConnect offers a solution that helps the developers to link dApps and wallets effortlessly. In this article, let&#8217;s understand WalletConnect in depth.</p>



<h2>What is WalletConnect?</h2>



<p>WalletConnect is a single-integration and open-source protocol. Developers can use WalletConnect to let users from 166 wallets to log into decentralized applications they have developed. These programs, commonly known as dApps, are hosted on decentralized networks like the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-ethereum-virtual-machine-evm/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum Virtual Machine</a>.</p>



<p>Since WalletConnect is open-source, no private keys are ever disclosed, and the connection is secured. Additionally, anybody can help build it or include it in their dApp.</p>



<h2>Features of a WalletConnect</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Chain agnostic:</strong></li></ul>



<p>As of now, WalletConnect supports a wide range of various chains. This implies that WalletConnect can be used, for example, when working with Ethereum or Solana. WalletConnect&#8217;s official website also states that the protocol will eventually be expanded to allow even more chains.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Multi-chain integration:</strong></li></ul>



<p>In addition to the protocol supporting several chains, it also allows multi-chain integration. This implies that the wallet may be concurrently connected to several chains.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Platform agnostic:</strong></li></ul>



<p>Moreover, WalletConnect is platform-independent. This implies that the protocol can be used on multiple platforms, including desktop, browser, mobile, and gaming software.</p>



<h2>How to use a WalletConnect (on both Desktop and Mobile dApp)?</h2>



<p>Following are instructions on using WalletConnect on desktop and mobile dApps:</p>



<p><strong>Step 1: Open an appropriate dApp</strong></p>



<p>Choose the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-dapps/" data-wpel-link="internal">dApp</a> you wish to use on your desktop or mobile browser.</p>



<p><strong>Step 2: Link Your Wallet</strong></p>



<p>Today, almost all dApps on Ethereum have a &#8216;Connect your Wallet&#8217; feature or a similar option. So use your wallet and choose this option. You will be able to link via WalletConnect If the dApp supports it.</p>



<p>On Desktop &#8211; After choosing WalletConnect, scan the displayed QR code with your wallet.</p>



<p>On Mobile &#8211; If you&#8217;re running a dApp on your mobile browser, you&#8217;ll get an option to &#8220;Choose your preferred wallet&#8221; after selecting the WalletConnect option in the dApp. Then, you are only required to tap on the icon next to the wallet you want to connect to.</p>



<p>Once your wallet is opened, you may proceed to authorize the dApp.</p>



<p><strong>Step 3: Authorize dApp</strong>.</p>



<p>Your wallet will then send you a notification asking for your permission to connect to your wallet.</p>



<p>When you give a dApp authorization, you provide access to your wallet and the ability to withdraw assets (i.e., tokens) up to the specified limit.</p>



<p>dApp authorization can be withdrawn at any moment.</p>



<p><strong>Step 4: Confirm the transaction</strong></p>



<p>You will be linked, and now the WalletConnect should be accessible to you.</p>



<p>When you use the dApp to perform a transaction, a popup will display in your wallet asking for your consent to make the transaction.</p>



<p>You should pay <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/4-ways-to-avoid-high-ethereum-gas-fees/" data-wpel-link="internal">network fees (&#8220;gas&#8221;)</a> as with any other transaction.</p>



<p>If you don&#8217;t intend to use the dApp anymore after that, don&#8217;t forget to disconnect your wallet from it.</p>



<h2>Quick tips for securely using WalletConnect</h2>



<p>Your connection to a dApp is secured when you use WalletConnect, and your private key is never disclosed. But security issues still need to be addressed.</p>



<p>Here are some tips for enhancing user security:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Verify that you are using the genuine dApp.</strong></li></ul>



<p>By looking at the URL, you can be sure you&#8217;re using the actual dApp. Attackers have been known to fabricate bogus websites in an effort to steal your tokens.</p>



<p>Avoid hitting the first link in your search results (mainly if it&#8217;s a paid advertisement); this is another strategy to lower the danger.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Limit the quantity of tokens that can be approved.</strong></li></ul>



<p>Unfortunately, dApps frequently request your permission to possibly withdraw an almost infinite quantity of tokens from your wallet. This is because they want to simplify the experience by minimizing the number of transactions you make.</p>



<h2>Is WalletConnect safe to use?</h2>



<p>Yes! Data is symmetrically encrypted before being transported between dApps and wallets with a key that only these two entities have.</p>



<p>The dApp sends the key directly to the wallet. There are no middlemen, whether consumers opt to deep connect via a desktop wallet or scan the QR code.</p>



<p>A public bridge server handles the information transfer between the two, but the server is not given the key that is required to decode the data. Additionally, developers have the option of hosting their own bridge servers for total security.</p>



<p>The brilliance of this design is that WalletConnect can log in to a dApp without requiring your recovery phrase or seed.</p>



<h2>Curtain thoughts</h2>



<p>WalletConnect is a well-liked tool in the DeFi DApp community. It simply takes a few minutes to learn how to use, giving you access to a wide range of services. In addition, WalletConnect is a helpful tool for accessing DApps while on the go as crypto wallets become increasingly more portable.</p>

<p>Looking for a reliable tool to search through all of the publicly available data on the Ethereum blockchain? Etherscan is a tool that lets you explore the data from transactions, wallet addresses, smart contracts, and other sources. Furthermore, Etherscan stands free from the Ethereum Foundation. The non-profit organization neither sponsors nor manages the application.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Etherscan platform was created by a team of seasoned developers with the goal of making the Ethereum blockchain more approachable for everyday consumers. Users can search through the Ethereum Network effortlessly by using EtherScan, despite its centralized nature. </p>



<h2>What is Etherscan?</h2>



<p>Etherscan is a website where you may conduct block exploration on the Ethereum blockchain. You can look for prior deals, wallets, smart contracts, and other information about Ethereum-based assets and trades using Etherscan.</p>



<p>The native currency of the Ethereum network, ether, is a favorite for investment, trading, and other cryptocurrency-related activities. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency in the world by market capitalization. All transactions are publicly recorded in a sizable database known as a blockchain, just like other cryptocurrencies. Using Etherscan, you can learn more about all of the transactions that have taken place on the Ethereum network, from the exchange of currencies to the acquisition of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).</p>



<h2>Why should one use Etherscan?</h2>



<p>Etherscan is one of the most dependable and well-known block explorers for Ethereum. It&#8217;s crucial to comprehend why you should inspect on-chain data using a block explorer like Etherscan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using Etherscan, users can:</p>



<ul><li>Use the Etherscan gas tracker to determine Ethereum gas prices.</li><li>Search for and validate smart contracts.</li><li>Find out which smart contracts have a security audit and validated source code.</li><li>Count the number of smart contracts a user has approved using their wallet.</li><li>Access key data like market cap, volume, and the number of holders for any ERC-20 Token.</li><li>View the cryptocurrency assets linked to or kept in a public wallet address.</li><li>Track actual transactions that occur on the Ethereum blockchain.</li><li>Look up any Ethereum wallet transaction.</li></ul>



<p>Understanding how you interact with the blockchain can improve your comprehension of how DApps and transactions work. Additionally, this information might help you stay safe and identify nefarious blockchain activity.</p>



<p>For instance, whale alerts notify you when significant quantities of cryptocurrency are transferred to an exchange. This information might indicate a significant sell-off, but this isn&#8217;t always the case. Additionally, you can track a project&#8217;s creators&#8217; tokens. The platform can assist you in identifying possible scams, and coin pulls.</p>



<h2>How to use EtherScan?</h2>



<p>You can go directly to the website and begin searching to enjoy most of Etherscan&#8217;s features. However, you will require the wallet&#8217;s public address or the transaction ID in order to locate a specific wallet, transaction, or other digital assets.</p>



<p>By address, transaction hash (transaction ID), block, token, or across the Ethereum Name System, you may search with Etherscan (ENS). On the homepage, you can also look through recent transactions and discover more about the condition of the Ethereum network right now.</p>



<p>Additionally, the online application allows for the optional creation of an account. With a free account, you may set up a public profile, write notes, get alerts, and build watch lists to monitor your wallets and accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at some of the functions of Etherscan and how to use them.</p>



<h3><strong>Gas Tracker</strong></h3>



<p>The transaction fee necessary for a transaction to be completed on the Ethereum blockchain is referred to as &#8220;Gas.&#8221; Gas fees are what Ethereum users pay for transactions. The cost for each block varies according to the network traffic. You can see the price and time differences at various gas prices with the Etherscan <a href="https://etherscan.io/gasTracker" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">gas tracker</a>. It&#8217;s a helpful tool to estimate how crowded the network is and how much you&#8217;d probably have to spend to conduct a straightforward transfer or engage with a more complex smart contract.</p>



<p>Etherscan also shows historical gas prices. When the transaction is not time-sensitive, users can set their gas price at the preferred price. Most wallets allow you to choose your gas pricing when you make transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Track Wallet Balance &amp; History</strong></h3>



<p>Explorers can look up the wallet address on Etherscan by choosing the &#8220;Analytics&#8221; tab on Etherscan. This feature enables an explorer to observe how the balance in a user&#8217;s wallet has changed over time. Users can see a user&#8217;s wallet data analytics from here, including the user&#8217;s ETH balance, the complete history of transfers, transactions, and fees paid. Tracking wallets and history enable users to track Whale wallets.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Look up a Transaction</strong></h3>



<p>The &#8220;Transactions&#8221; tab on Etherscan will display a list of all ETH transactions (Txns) or transactions that have utilized gas (Gwei) connected with a particular wallet address. On the Etherscan homepage, enter the wallet address and click &#8220;Search.&#8221; You will be directed to a screen that lists all of the wallet&#8217;s details.</p>



<h3><strong>Smart Contracts&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>The &#8220;Read Contract&#8221; and &#8220;Write Contract&#8221; functions of the Etherscan app allow for the reading and editing of smart contracts without the need for additional permissions. Real-time data on various tokens and smart contracts is available on these tabs. Users can use these functionalities to launch token transfers and authorize smart contract transactions.</p>



<p>Read more about Smart Contracts <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-are-smart-contracts-and-why-you-need-to-know-about-them/" data-wpel-link="internal">here</a>.</p>



<h3><strong>ERC-20 Token Tracker</strong></h3>



<p>Users <a href="https://etherscan.io/tokens" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">can find</a> almost any ERC-20 token on Etherscan. Essential information, including market cap, volume, and holder count, is readily accessible on the platform. Furthermore, details like the amount of funds coming in and going out and the change in holdings are also available to users.</p>



<h2>Do I need an account?</h2>



<p>Etherscan doesn&#8217;t mandate sign-ups, although doing so gives you access to more features. For instance, you can use developer tools, set up data feeds, and establish alerts to be informed of incoming transactions.</p>



<p>Although some users might want to use the website without registering due to the semi-anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies; registering to the block explorer establishes a new digital link between you and your wallet, which some users might prefer to keep private.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>When you need more information than your wallet or exchange can provide, Etherscan is an excellent tool. You may easily pick up how to use the most basic functions in a short period of time. For example, the smart contract code can be examined with Etherscan, along with gas prices and real-time Ethereum blockchain monitoring.</p>



<p>Finally, Etherscan is open source and free; and users do not need to register to use any of its functions. Overall, it&#8217;s a terrific place to start for users who want to learn about their Ethereum wallet and the entire spectrum of features of a blockchain.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies are not traded in the same manner that equities are on Wall Street. Nonetheless, a number of publicly listed enterprises are inextricably linked to the realm of cryptocurrency or other digital assets.</p>



<p>Cryptocurrency stocks are shares in firms that offer cryptocurrency-based services, like running crypto exchanges, investing in cryptocurrencies, or manufacturing equipment needed to mine cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Every market has risks, and crypto stocks may be subject to possible downturns in the unpredictable cryptocurrency markets. For investors that are experienced with stocks and seek crypto exposure, crypto stocks may be a good option. This is why cryptocurrency IPOs, or Initial Public Offerings, are the new trend among traditional investors.</p>



<p>Before we delve in further, let&#8217;s first get the basics right.</p>



<h2>What is an IPO?</h2>



<p>An initial public offering (IPO) is the process through which a private corporation offers crypto assets from its business to the general public in new issuance. The method allows a cryptocurrency firm to receive funds from public investors, but it must adhere to laws that require increased disclosures and transparency.</p>



<p>A corporation is deemed private before an IPO and is held by a small number of stakeholders. These stakeholders can include early investors such as the founders, the founders&#8217; family, and friends, or venture capitalists who contribute funds to firms with strong development potential.</p>



<p>The company&#8217;s tokens are then released on the IPO launch day, with a portion reserved for the underwriters who assisted in getting it listed on a public cryptocurrency exchange. The capital invested in purchasing the issued tokens is repaid in the form of coins.</p>



<p>Not everyone can invest in IPOs since demand sometimes surpasses the number of coins issued to the public. Frequently, brokerage houses may only allow clients with a specified amount of assets or who fulfill certain trading standards to participate in IPOs.</p>



<p>Existing token holders may be subject to lock-up agreements, which restrict them from immediately selling their currencies. These lock-up clauses must be considered before investing in an IPO. Existing token holders may sell all of their coins on the market when they expire, causing price reductions.</p>



<p>Underwriters frequently price IPOs at a discount to guarantee that there is more demand than supply. The price is determined after the firm is appraised using many indications, including the amount of money predicted to be generated in the future.</p>



<p>Following an IPO, the price of a company&#8217;s coins may fluctuate dramatically as investors who missed out on the IPO come in and existing coin holders change their positions. If underwriters and investment banks overhype an IPO, the coins may incur significant first losses when trading begins.</p>



<p>But why would a cryptocurrency firm opt for an IPO instead of traditional crypto approaches like ICOs?</p>



<h2>The benefits of IPO</h2>



<p>Companies benefit from initial public offerings in a variety of ways, the most important of which is capital acquisition. A key advantage of being publicly listed for cryptocurrency firms is the greater visibility and credibility that comes with it.</p>



<p>Companies that are publicly listed must enhance their transparency since they are required to notify investors and shareholders of their financial and strategic condition every quarter. Companies in the crypto sector benefit from a more positive public perception thanks to improved transparency and the added confidence that comes with meeting all of the legal requirements for an IPO and being listed on a public exchange.</p>



<p>The additional visibility that a firm receives by being publicly listed may also bring in new consumers. A crypto corporation that has worked with authorities and crypto exchanges to IPO is more likely to be trustworthy than a startup. Furthermore, quarterly reporting explains a crypto company&#8217;s financial status, resulting in better credit borrowing terms.</p>



<p>Because anyone may buy and sell the company&#8217;s coins, the liquidity of these currencies is greatly increased. Increased liquidity increases the value of the cryptocurrency, making it simpler for holders to sell some or all of their holdings.</p>



<p>An IPO allows a firm to get access to public markets and raise funds more readily through secondary offerings. These secondary offerings are basically the sale of new or privately owned coins of a firm that has already completed an initial public offering.</p>



<p>The creation of new coins and the subsequent selling of them to the public may dilute the value of existing coins already on the market. Alternatively, one or more large coin holders may sell their holdings in a secondary offering and collect the profits of the sale.</p>



<p>Finally, if a firm is publicly listed, it may offer remuneration in the form of its coins, which are more liquid due to their listing on crypto exchanges. Better management may be attracted by offering coin incentives in exchange for helping the firm expand. If the company&#8217;s value rises, the price of its coins or tokens will rise as well.</p>



<p>To sum it all up, the core advantage of moving forward with an IPO is the added public visibility and enhanced credibility.</p>



<h2>Which cryptocurrency firms have gone public?</h2>



<p>There are several blockchain firms that have gone public over the past years. Some of the most notable ones are:</p>



<p><strong>Coinbase Global Inc.</strong></p>



<p>Coinbase (ticker: COIN) operates as one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States. In April 2021, it was the first true cryptocurrency platform to go public. Coinbase makes revenue by allowing users to purchase and sell a wide range of digital assets on its platform.</p>



<p><strong>MicroStrategy Inc.</strong></p>



<p>MicroStrategy (MSTR) is an analytics software firm that has amassed a significant amount of Bitcoin, the first and most valued cryptocurrency. MicroStrategy stated on February 14 that it possessed more than $5.2 billion in Bitcoin, which was close to the company&#8217;s total market valuation at the time.</p>



<p><strong>Marathon Digital Holdings Inc</strong></p>



<p>Marathon (ticker: MARA) is another firm that is extensively involved with Bitcoin, allowing investors to obtain exposure to the commodity without directly purchasing it. Marathon mines Bitcoin directly and invests in the digital currency. Marathon reported that it had around $387 million in Bitcoin by the end of 2021.</p>



<p><strong>Block Inc.</strong></p>



<p>Block (SQ), previously Square, is a financial services and payment processing firm. It operates in numerous areas relating to blockchain technology and Bitcoin, and its popular Cash App application lets users trade in equities and Bitcoin. Block stated that it had $317 million in digital assets by the end of 2021.</p>



<h2>So, What does crypto companies going public mean for the industry?</h2>



<p>Going public with a cryptocurrency company may have a positive or negative impact on the cryptocurrency market as a whole. This is due to the fact that it is one of the market&#8217;s mainstays. As a result, any changes it undergoes will immediately influence the superstructure that relies on it, depending on the outcome of such activities.</p>



<p>We can forecast that one of the beneficial effects of more cryptocurrency firms going public will be an increase in the price of basic cryptocurrencies. This projection is based on a thorough examination of the current market. Going public will boost investor trust, resulting in an infusion of new stakeholders eager to participate in the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>Naturally, the DeFi market will follow suit. The demand for the services provided by this market will skyrocket among people looking to buy digital assets quickly. Indeed, a trading frenzy is predicted to occur ahead of the initial sale of a company&#8217;s shares, and so the number of people clamoring to buy it will increase.</p>



<p>However, while this move will open up a whole new universe of possibilities, it may also result in a number of negative outcomes. In contrast to the expected barrier-breaking event, it may eventually act as a barrier-creating event. This hypothesis stems from the fact that cryptocurrency platforms do not use fiat money in any manner; they are all primarily crypto-centric. This fact would only increase constraints and cause skepticism and prudence among casual investors.</p>



<p>Another negative potential stems from the unpredictability of IPO participation levels and the degree of fallout that may occur. Facebook&#8217;s IPO had a decent attendance at the launch. The next day, however, share values dropped, and the delight of important stakeholders faded.</p>



<p>We may see a similar outcome for cryptocurrency platforms if the firms&#8217; entry into the traditional financial market fails to live up to the anticipation among typical investors. People in the crypto space as a whole could be very disappointed by the results. They may then cause a significant dip in the prices of certain cryptocurrencies that traders purchased in anticipation of a significant increase in price.</p>



<p>Cryptocurrency IPOs are undeniably major milestones for the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries as a whole. However, there are still dangers that the sale of their shares would result in either huge price hikes or a big drop, hurting the average investor&#8217;s confidence in digital assets. Whatever scenario plays out, it&#8217;s a win-win situation for the crypto firms. This is due to the firms&#8217; increased presence in the traditional financial sector.</p>



<h2>Looking ahead</h2>



<p>Crypto firms going public is a significant market signal. However, no one is certain of its long-term repercussions on the sector, whether negative or positive. Even so, these listings represent a significant step forward for the blockchain sector, indicating the acceptance of cryptocurrencies in traditional finance. By continuing to offer consumers services related to the cryptocurrency industry, the success of these firms and their direct listing will herald the next wave of users into the crypto market.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency prices have collapsed, numerous crypto projects have failed, many firms are having financial difficulties, they are no longer employing, and the usual &#8220;crypto is dead&#8221; stories are making their way into the mainstream media. So things are definitely not on the brighter side.</p>



<p>However, those who have been a part of the crypto world for some time are experiencing it today and have seen it all before. They know how cyclical cryptocurrency is, with bear and bull markets. In the bull market, which began in late 2020 and finished in late 2021, prices rose by double digits every day. It seemed as though the market would only rise at that time. But, when we talk about the bear market, prices may drop by 90%, then by another 90%, and so on.</p>



<p>Even though the past <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/5-ways-to-survive-the-crypto-bear-market-2022/" data-wpel-link="internal">crypto bear markets</a> corresponded with positive equity emotions, Crypto today has a strong correlation to a macro environment with a possible recession shortly.</p>



<p>What should you do now? Panic? High on stress and anxiety? Or should you increase your investment tally? If you have experienced a bear market previously, then you must be aware of what mistakes you don&#8217;t have to make again and how you can stay calm in such situations. But, if you are a newbie crypto investor, you are bound to make mistakes during a bear market. So, let&#8217;s have a look at what are the possible mistakes that you can make and how you can stay away from such mistakes.</p>



<h2>Take a profit</h2>



<p>The main question here is &#8220;whether to HODL or not HODL?&#8221;</p>



<p>In Crypto, HODLing/ holding or the reluctance to sell despite a bleak outlook is common. Compromising your lifestyle based on a HODL meme is not considered a wise decision; you should always remember that nobody lost everything after making a profit.</p>



<p>Selling a portion of your gains is what is meant by &#8220;taking a profit.&#8221; It never implies fully exiting the market. At the very least, establish sell goals, take profit levels in advance, and adhere to them. Your analytical self is always a better counsel; believe in it.</p>



<h2>Don&#8217;t sell in panic, but also don&#8217;t be greedy.</h2>



<p>Panic selling doesn&#8217;t constitute to taking a profit and planning an exit strategy from the market.</p>



<p>Until and unless you are not in immediate need of cash, avoid panic selling.</p>



<p>Sometimes you want to be on the top and are frightened to miss that place; in such times, you may become greedy. So, always make your selling decisions based on statistics, not emotion or suggestions on social media.</p>



<h2>Try to stay solvent</h2>



<p>Most investors who made crypto investments in late 2020 saw their portfolios reach greater heights in April or November 2021. However, the fireworks are over.</p>



<p>According to experts&#8217; advice, don&#8217;t trade or invest with the idea of &#8220;making back&#8221; what you lost during the bull market; this is because the comparison is intrinsically false.</p>



<p>Revenge trading may go horribly wrong even if it may be alluring to attempt to &#8220;make it back in one trade&#8221; by engaging in extremely risky trades. Staying solvent is essential in a bear market, and it helps if one doesn&#8217;t &#8220;touch leverage.&#8221;</p>



<p>Leverage is a common strategy in crypto markets, but using it to purchase coins in a declining market has a significantly higher possibility of disaster and will deplete your mental capital, as well. Moreover, even if you succeed in getting a decent entry, your odds of maintaining a powerful position of that size are dramatically reduced.</p>



<h2>Always research your favorite projects</h2>



<p>Crypto always provides a space for innovation and experimentation. Numerous projects are created, vanish off, re-invent themselves, flourish, and are forgotten. All the crypto projects have tokens linked to them, especially in the beginning, and the success of the projects is frequently (but not always) correlated with the performance of the tokens.</p>



<p>All you need to do is keep an eye on new and old projects during the bearish or bullish run. You&#8217;ll need to re-investigate the projects now and then, as the projects can diverge from their original plan and discover a better product that fits the market.</p>



<h2>Have an &#8220;ape&#8221; fund</h2>



<p>&#8220;Apeing&#8221; is a term that gained popularity after the Bored Apes launched. It simply refers to investing in the Crypto that has been hyped in the market, and you are not very keen on having due diligence, as you believe that the Crypto is all new and shiny and may soon rise in value.</p>



<p>&nbsp;This strategy mainly works in the bull market rather than the bear market. For your future investments, you should keep researching the crypto projects, keep an eye on the upcoming ones, and have an &#8220;ape&#8221; fund ready for the right time.</p>



<p>To learn more about apeing, click <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-apeing/" data-wpel-link="internal">here</a>!</p>



<h2>Have a life outside Crypto, as well!</h2>



<p>Crypto is a market that operates 24/7 and never stops. Once you enter, there&#8217;s no going back; it may feel like a binge-worthy Netflix series. But don&#8217;t get carried away and lose sight of other things in life. Instead, have friends, develop some hobbies, indulge in book reading or cooking, and travel some cities.</p>



<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>



<p>The bear market is here to stay a little longer with us, and we should not lose our hopes on good crypto projects. However, before taking any steps towards investing in your favorite Crypto, check all the points mentioned in this article that we have curated for newbie investors (who are experiencing a bear market for the first time!)</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s HODL together!</p>

<p>One thing has been constant since the introduction of bitcoin in late 2009: the cryptocurrency market is very volatile. The best indicator of the crypto market is the price of Bitcoin since it has the largest market cap.</p>



<p>Bitcoin has experienced significant ups and downs over time. There have been instances when Bitcoin has crashed by more than 40%, and each time has come back stronger. Recently, Bitcoin reached a high of $68,000 in 2021 before dropping to $20,000 in June 2022. It is currently trading for $23,518.66 (a bounce-back from a 52-Week Low at $17,708.62). This year saw bitcoin suffer its worst quarterly loss in 11 years. Let us take a look at the crypto crashes and bear market scenarios over a period of time.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>1. <strong>The First Bear Market: 2011-2012</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/HCNAoQJGWYuxUs5_MiMsE73teK-G98LDF2yA5bjvtP2kbgUa8_fnV1DyO695I4oDYAvb3bdA4dzezluysR73nsOMFnacuJuUEFWyRFThVTz_BjQqS3_dcvvksfU8lLoYzAGcE0i_SPbp6we-Wql1Fg" alt="" /><figcaption>The 2011-12 bear market. Source: <a href="https://coinmetrics.io/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Coinmetrics.io</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Long before most of us were even aware that something like crypto existed, the worst bear market unfolded. In 2011, the price of Bitcoin had reached $32, only to fall to $2.10 in a few months&#8217; time.&nbsp;Bitcoin plunged 93% in value! </p>



<p>But think about this: even at the all-time high (ATH) price of $30, purchasing bitcoin would have been great. Who wouldn’t want to stockpile some bitcoin for $30?</p>



<p>Over the past ten years, the perspective of bitcoin has changed as it transitioned from a geeky experiment to an inflation hedge and, possibly, the foundation of the following global monetary system. Early in 2013, the price broke through the previous ATH and never dropped below that mark again.</p>



<h2>2. <strong>Bear Market 2.0: 2014-2016</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/0CrMAM5oj6nZmKq-CaXdoDyw4lEGXNVUvtfQvPcwZffrvcM6YYlM42-pzxl1En93krtiO8WIfq3aAMoyoESY5OlHr9OHwqy3s_d384g4w_jHIQ480unbkbTgPRBGSnJxyIvbYIbFAMaBTuv2gCMj7Es" alt="" /><figcaption> The 2014-2015 bear market. Source: <a href="https://coinmetrics.io/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Coinmetrics.io</a> </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Bitcoin reached $100 in April 2013 and $1,000 for the first time ever in November of the same year.</p>



<p>Later in December, though, the Chinese government forbade financial institutions from carrying out bitcoin transactions, claiming they were useless. As a result, on Bitcoin China, the biggest cryptocurrency exchange at the time, bitcoin’s price dropped from $1,000 to $700 in a single month. The Mt. Gox cryptocurrency exchange platform’s downfall is partly to blame for the 2014 crypto winter. The Japanese exchange filed for bankruptcy both in Tokyo and the United States.</p>



<p>Bitcoin’s price eventually fell during this bear market from $1,135 on December 4, 2013, to $175 on January 14, 2015. Before things started to turn around in August 2015, investors had lost faith in bitcoin. But Bitcoin bounced back at a price of $1,000 in January 2017.</p>



<h2>3. <strong>Crypto Winter Chills:&nbsp; 2018-2020</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VyBXVto_hOnL9wXlbdVQYSaQVMpWaDrbmS20rLTmM2d-1J7KXufaC8DVBzI6Y32getEjJE43et0F1WJUYZp0VBJnPfwsa-pz1Vyi8kn8AxmbP9R9JYoo-r67VBSoBnFdx7gW_K2BzRt4CNTTd7RVvrU" alt="" /><figcaption>  The 2018-2020 bear market. Source: <a href="https://coinmetrics.io/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Coinmetrics.io</a>  </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>A price drop from $19,640 on December 16, 2017, to $3,185 on December 15, 2018, followed by months of sideways movement, was one of the most well-known downfalls in Bitcoin’s history. On the one hand, Coincheck, one of the biggest Japanese cryptocurrency exchanges, was compromised. On the other hand, however, due to the uncontrolled nature of cryptocurrencies, the US Securities and Exchange Commission rejected applications for bitcoin exchange-traded funds in July 2018.</p>



<p>But again, bitcoin bounced back. After reaching $20,000, bitcoin started a new bull run in 2020. It reached $63k in April 2021. The market value of cryptocurrencies topped $1 trillion during the bullish wave.</p>



<h2>4. <strong>Is the Winter here again?: 2022 Market Crash</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/l2bP0KyzmL0IvcRCZlxfgrJfbn3WS1958SZ-1LqMpqlS931OQL2NCYlLWDfa_Mi0YJbpX9_T0U2dYmlWY2F4dOAL5iOhKV_miwOhlcceOFjWzUtBPpTcB0QYhO20Z6sFdizYgIh1f-bleSs2GtuFVFk" alt="" width="840" height="497" /><figcaption>The 2021-22 Market. Source: <a href="https://coinmetrics.io/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Coinmetrics.io</a>  </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Bitcoin is currently going through a dramatic crash. The price drops below $20,000 in July after reaching an ATH of $68,000 in November 2021. The collapse of TerraUSD Classic (USTC), a significant blockchain stablecoin, is what caused the market to drop. Instead of employing equal cash reserves, these stablecoins were pegged 1:1 to the US dollar using algorithms.</p>



<p>USTC lost its dollar peg in May. It had risen to the position of third-largest stablecoin at this point. However, following the de-pegging, the crypto community descended into anarchy as the ecosystem failed.</p>



<p>Investors began selling off their holdings, which increased uncertainty and sent the price of cryptocurrencies spiraling lower. Finally, Celsius’s cryptocurrency staking and the lending site stopped all withdrawals due to the terrible liquidity issue.</p>



<h2><strong>Curtain Thoughts</strong></h2>



<p>Bear markets are neither unexpected nor frightening. On the contrary, they contribute to the development of bitcoin as a universally accepted form of money. This seasonality of the crypto market explains a pattern of ups and downs. Most investors who have been in the market for a long term now understand that Bitcoin strikes back, and when it comes back, it comes back with a vengeance. Therefore, it is essential to remember that this isn’t the end; in fact, this might be the beginning of various upgrades and bolstering of crypto as an asset class.</p>



<p>Let’s keep BUIDLing for the upcoming bull run!</p>

<p>To truly dive into the world of crypto, it&#8217;s crucial to learn about various coins, their advantages and disadvantages, and related news. But, do you know what else is also important? Learning the crypto slang. Yes, these crypto slangs play a significant role in improving your crypto knowledge. You must have heard &#8211; FOMO, HODL, <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/is-this-the-endgame-of-decentralization-in-defi/" data-wpel-link="internal">Whale</a>, FUD, etc. And among them, one such term is &#8220;Ape.&#8221;</p>



<p>In this article, let&#8217;s learn about apeing and how you can profit from it.</p>



<p>In simple terms, aping can be defined as purchasing a new coin. If you follow crypto Twitter, you may have encountered a conversation where someone asks, &#8220;What coin are you apeing into?&#8221; which means, &#8220;What coin are you buying?&#8221;</p>



<p>In recent times, the crypto world has been &#8220;apeing into&#8221; the actual apes; yes, we are talking about the Bored Apes from the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC).</p>



<h2>What is Apeing?</h2>



<p>Apeing happens when a crypto investor purchases a token shortly after the token project&#8217;s launch without doing extensive research, typically out of fear of losing out on potential gains that might be missed if they wait to conduct due diligence.</p>



<p>The word &#8220;apeing&#8221; gained popularity in the 2020 &#8220;DeFi Summer,&#8221; when sudden and unannounced token project releases resulted in a tiny percentage of investors generating significant profit from purchasing those project tokens within a short time following the original launch.</p>



<p>As such stories started to gain traction on social media, other investors tried to imitate them by purchasing tokens for every new project released without extensive research. This &#8220;low IQ&#8221; strategy of choosing tokens to invest in gave apeing its nickname.</p>



<h2>How does FOMO come into the picture?</h2>



<p>On an individual level, FOMO arises from the belief that other traders are making huge profits while you are not, and therefore you too want what they are having.</p>



<p>As a result, it leads to a lack of long-term perspective, a reluctance to wait, under- or over-confidence, and unrealistic expectations. FOMO is a form of emotional trading that lacks objectivity and, if left unattended, can force investors to abandon their investing strategy and take on too much risk.</p>



<p>To overcome FOMO in trading, you must first combat negative emotions like greed and anxiety. These emotions can keep you trapped in the FOMO cycle, in which you buy high for greed, envy, jealousy, and excitement and sell low for fear, anxiety, and impatience, only to be enticed to buy again when the market rises and hits another top.</p>



<h2>The connection between Apeing and FOMO</h2>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-to-buy-apecoin-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">Apeing</a> is considered the primary characteristic of FOMO-dominated traders.</p>



<p>FOMO is a familiar opponent for all investors and traders since it affects their decision-making on multiple levels. For example, it can force them to enter trades too quickly without confirmation and chase after opportunities that have passed.</p>



<p>By having solid control of trading psychology, traders and investors can manage FOMO and prevent it from impacting their decisions. However, not every trader or investor has mastered investor psychology. Many of them still act FOMO-driven and exhibit the following characteristics:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Greed</strong></li></ul>



<p>A FOMO-driven trader wants everything now. Suppose this is how you feel while trading; FOMO is most likely an issue for you. However, you&#8217;re probably more concerned about how much money you can make on a trade instead of focusing on executing your former trades correctly.</p>



<ul><li><strong>The herd mentality</strong></li></ul>



<p>A trader suffering from FOMO frequently prefers to do things just because others are doing them rather than because they know why those investors are buying or selling a specific asset. Following the herd in trading can lead to imprudent investing and terrible consequences.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Impatience</strong></li></ul>



<p>Traders that are impacted by FOMO are frequently impatient. They don&#8217;t want to wait for the perfect signal; they want to get in because they&#8217;re worried the price will shift and leave them behind, robbing them of a great chance.</p>



<ul><li><strong>High expectations</strong></li></ul>



<p>Some traders have unreasonable expectations. They trade impulsively to double their balances in a few months.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Lack of confidence</strong></li></ul>



<p>After multiple failed trades, some traders&#8217; primary goal is to repay those losses in a short period and with a few winning deals. As a result, they start trading at random to earn a quick profit and recoup their losses. Unfortunately, this results in more losses.</p>



<ul><li><strong>No long-term perspective</strong></li></ul>



<p>FOMO-prone traders typically don&#8217;t approach trading with a long-term mindset. If that were the case, they would be aware that thousands of new trades await them and would be unconcerned about that single trade.</p>



<h2>Final words</h2>



<p>As a crypto trader/ investor, you should always keep your eyes and mind open before trading. Being high on emotions will lead you to new losses. So always DYOR and play it safe!</p>

<p>What will motivate you to get more exercise? The creators of STEPN believe that the obvious solution is a large sum of money. STEPN claims to be a Web3 lifestyle application with built-in Game-Fi and Social-Fi capabilities. Users may earn tokens for walking, jogging, or running in the open air, and the app&#8217;s developers hope that this will encourage users to adopt a healthier lifestyle. Since its launch just a year ago, millions of people have signed up for their move-to-earn jogging software that gives monetary incentives for getting more active.</p>



<p>An Australian fintech company called Satoshi Lab developed STEPN. It was founded by Jerry Huang and Yawn Rong. The project received first place in the Solana Ignition Hackathon Gaming Track. Moreover, it is the only mobile game to win a prize at the Hackathon. The judges at the Hackathon applauded STEPN for its game design, built-in marketplace, user-friendly user interface, wallet, and its objective of enticing millions of non-crypto users to use the app.</p>



<p>The first Web3 running app secured a $5.0M seed round. Some of the most prestigious VC firms, such as Solana, DeFi, MorningStar, Sequoia, and others, have all invested in STEPN&#8217;s ambitious plans.</p>



<p>As you read this, you&#8217;ll learn about the workings of STEPN, what the coin is used for, where you can purchase STEPN (GMT), and how you can generate money with it by just going for a jog or stroll outside.</p>



<h2>So, How does STEPN work?</h2>



<p>Users must first install the STEPN app. The next step is to sign up for STEPN with their email address. After completing the verification process, users may begin exploring the STEPN coin.</p>



<p>The Game-Fi system of STEPN makes use of NFTs in the form of. To purchase NFT shoes, users must first deposit Solana&#8217;s native SOL token into STEPN&#8217;s in-app wallet and then wait 24 hours for their energy to be restored. The number of minutes a sneaker NFT user can work out is measured in energy.</p>



<p>Resilience, efficiency, and comfort are selectable properties. Your sneaker&#8217;s energy capacity is influenced by its many characteristics. Because the supply of rewards is limited, the energy cap plays an important role in bottlenecking distribution.</p>

<p>Source: STEPN</p>



<p>In the STEPN ecosystem, there are two tokens: the Green Satoshi Token (GST), which is the game&#8217;s utility token and has an infinite supply, and the Green Metaverse Token (GMT), which is the governance token. How many STEPN (GMT) coins are there? The total number of GMT tokens available is restricted to 6 billion.</p>



<p>GMT&#8217;s price saw a meteoric rise of 34,000% in just 41 days, from $0.01 on March 9, 2022, to $3.45 back in April. Its ascent was spurred by the enthusiasm around decentralized finance applications that incentivize users with tokens for keeping active.</p>



<p>Users may sell/buy/lease/rent NFT shoes, gems, and badges on the built-in marketplace and earn game currency by jogging, walking, or running outside. For easy navigation, the marketplace features a basic filter and sort function.</p>



<p>For example, after your sneaker is charged up, you may start jogging and receiving GST utility token incentives (this is distributed from the 30 percent of the supply that is set aside for this purpose). However, STEPN&#8217;s rental and credit systems are still under development.</p>



<p>But rewards are not all that make STEPN such a popular and rapidly growing venture. It&#8217;s the entire ecosystem that&#8217;s drawing the attention of the community. To sum it up:</p>



<h3>Burn Mechanism</h3>



<p>Because tokens are in short supply, a burn mechanism is required to help more and more people live a healthy lifestyle. Through different in-app actions, this method is utilized to limit the circulation of both the GMT and GST tokens.</p>



<h3>Dual Token Model</h3>



<p>Because of the requirement for fundraising and functionality, the STEPN ecosystem operates on a dual-token economy paradigm. In this scenario, there are two tokens accessible for users to earn through multiple methods.</p>



<h4>Green Metaverse Token (GMT)</h4>



<p>GMT is the STEPN project&#8217;s native cryptocurrency, with a finite quantity of six billion tokens. It may be acquired in a variety of methods and through the Token Generation Event (TGE), where it can be minted.</p>



<h4>Green Satoshi Token (GST)</h4>



<p>Green Satoshi Currency is an in-game utility token that can be used to buy items from the app. GST, unlike the GMT token, has an infinite supply and may be minted in-game through basic movements.</p>



<h2>GMT and GST Token Applications</h2>



<p>As previously stated, the STEPN project operates on a dual token economy paradigm, with both tokens (GMT and GST) providing various benefits to its users:</p>



<p>GST is defined as a utility token that requires no investment other than operating or participating in various gaming activities. It is capable of repairing, unlocking/resetting, and even leveling up your sneakers. Users may use GST tokens to mint their footwear and improve gem items. Furthermore, it is extensively used to swap USDC.</p>



<p>GMT, in contrast to GST, is a governance token. GMT may also be obtained by just participating in various game activities, including running. These tokens enable you to level up and modify the name on your sneakers. Furthermore, they are utilized to distribute game revenues and high-level activities, both of which might be regarded as premium content. GMTs, like GST, may be exchanged for USDC once the shoes reach level 30 or above.</p>



<h2>Making money on STEPN</h2>



<p>Users may make money and freely engage in the action by accessing three STEPN game modes: solo, marathon, and background. While you will need footwear to start earning, you will not need anything to start jogging/running. New users may try out the app and all of its features for free. If you&#8217;re ready to commit and have some STEPN footwear, the earning meter will begin to fill up while you run.</p>



<h3>Solo mode</h3>



<p>In solo mode, participants move around wearing NFT shoes to collect GST tokens, but this requires energy. One unit of energy is sustained by five minutes of move &amp; earn movement, which may be refilled by purchasing an NFT sneaker. Before traveling, always check your energy, as there is no way to earn tokens if you don&#8217;t have any.</p>



<p>Furthermore, check that your GPS connection is not weak and that you are moving naturally. No GST tokens if you are moonwalking (moving with a weak GPS signal).</p>



<p>Furthermore, the token payout is shaped by a range of parameters such as the type of sneakers and the features of the sneakers, such as comfort, efficiency, and speed of movement. In the case of the sneaker&#8217;s efficiency attribute, for example, the greater the efficiency, the more GST a user makes every minute.</p>



<p>Users can only earn GST from Level 0 to Level 29; however, at Level 30, they have the option of continuing to receive GST or changing to GMT. Switching between these two earning options is completely up to the user. Nonetheless, when their energy is spent, users stop earning tokens.</p>



<h3>Marathon mode</h3>



<p>Users can register for weekly or monthly marathons under the &#8220;Marathon tab.&#8221; However, they must do so at least 24 hours before the selected marathon starts.</p>



<p>In weekly marathons, users can pick among 2.5, 5, or 7.5 kilometers marathons; however, they can only compete in one event at a time.</p>



<p>However, users may only run one monthly marathon at a time, regardless of whether it is five, ten, or fifteen kilometers long. It is critical to understand that sneakers cannot be repaired throughout the marathon.</p>



<h3>Background mode</h3>



<p>Users can earn GST tokens offline and without incurring repair costs if they have at least one pair of shoes in their inventory. While the STEPN app is switched off, the background mode takes the step count directly from the mobile device&#8217;s health data, which has no effect on the shoes&#8217; endurance.</p>



<h2>Points to remember</h2>



<p>But before you jump in on this project, here are a few things worth noting:</p>



<ul><li><strong>You need a pair of costly NFT sneakers</strong></li></ul>



<p>Earning on STEPN has an initial cost, and it is not cheap. Its shoes, which are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) accessible on the STEPN marketplace, are mandatory. Because the marketplace is constructed on Solana (SOL), you must pay with that cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, the cheapest NFT sneakers cost 13 SOL or more than INR 55,000. STEPN is developing a shoe rental service that will allow owners to rent out their sneakers to other users while sharing revenues. However, renters will forego a sizable percentage of the income; the split is 30% for tenants and 70% for owners.</p>



<ul><li><strong>It has a strong anti-cheat system</strong></li></ul>



<p>When I initially heard about STEPN, one of my first thoughts was how the application prevents individuals from just using it in their car or on their bikes to abuse the system. STEPN detects cheating using motion sensors, GPS, and machine learning. Cheaters who are found are banned from utilizing STEPN as well.</p>



<ul><li><strong>The app is still under development</strong></li></ul>



<p>It&#8217;s just been a year since STEPN was created, and there are still some glitches in the system. Many reviewers, particularly those who used the Google Play version of the app, complained about not obtaining an activation code or having difficulty creating an account.</p>



<p>There have also been some concerns concerning the app&#8217;s GPS. While STEPN has strived to improve its GPS accuracy, certain technical limitations impact all running apps and GPS devices, such as signal loss owing to ambient conditions and signal bouncing off tall buildings.</p>



<h2>So, Should you be bullish about STEPN?</h2>



<p>Participation in any cryptocurrency initiative is determined by your goals and ambitions. If you are unsure about the vision of a protocol in which you want to partake, please do comprehensive market research.</p>



<p>That being stated, you may be bullish or bearish on STEPN depending on how much you know about the app, its staff, and your financial objectives. Also, if your objectives align with the app&#8217;s vision, it may be an excellent investment opportunity for you. You can buy GMT (Green Metaverse Token) on WazirX from <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/GMT-USDT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">here</a>. If the answer is no, you should consider twice before investing your hard-earned money in something you don&#8217;t believe in.</p>

<p>Ethereum, despite being the alma mater of a majority of dApps and <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-defi/" data-wpel-link="internal">Defi platform</a>s, hasn’t been able to scale efficiently to make the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-dapps/" data-wpel-link="internal">dApps eligible for mainstream adoption</a>. The transaction throughput and gas fees are other trailing issues that often leave the developers frustrated. Ranked #173 in the cryptocurrency charts (as of 01 June 2022), <a href="https://chromia.com/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Chromia</a> seeks to tackle these issues by facilitating the development of secure dApps using familiar paradigms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chromia can help dApps scale to millions of users without compromising the user experience by rethinking blockchain architecture and making it more intuitive via relational databases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Curious to know more about Chromia? We’ve got you sorted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The article will discuss how Chromia works, Tokenomics of the CHR token, <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/CHR-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Chromia price in INR</a>, Chromia’s price prediction for the future, and much more.  </p>



<h2>What is Chromia?</h2>



<p>Chromia is a Layer-1 blockchain that acts as a Layer-2 EVM-compatible enhancement for Ethereum and BSC (Binance Smart Chain). It is a relational blockchain platform that allows developers to build dApps suited for mass-scale real-world use cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockchain is, at times, criticized as a dumb database technology that needs data that gets stored on the blockchain and is processed for the blockchain to interact with the users. In a modern world where day-to-day operations are powered by relational databases such as the web, banks, social networks, etc., blockchain as a digital ledger isn’t always the best bet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chromia combines blockchain tech and relational databases to make dApps more user-friendly and powerful. Many enterprises have used and optimized these relational databases for decades. Chromia can be used as a public, private or hybrid blockchain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CHR is the native token of the platform. Chromia (CoinMarketCap data) has a market capitalization of $142.89 million as of 01 June 2022. It is designed to bring developers, investors, and users together in a mutually beneficial relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Chromia’s USPs</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Rell </strong>is the custom programming language of the Chromia blockchain. It is very similar to SQL in terms of functionality. It has been specially designed for coding purposes. Developers can enhance the existing dApps and create new ones with greater scalability, improved data handling, and customizable fees. Rell is easier to use than other blockchain languages, and with just a few lines of code, developers can code 7-10x faster.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li>The <strong>Chromia Vault,</strong> a wallet software, helps users with a secure address to manage their tokens and dApps on the Chromia blockchain. The Vault also has ‘Single Sign On’ &#8211; a unique feature that eliminates the need for entering passwords each time a user logs in to their accounts without any compromise on the security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>Founders: </strong>The Chromia blockchain was founded by Henrik Hjelte, CEO of Chromia; Or Perelman, COO; and Alex Mizrahi, CTO of Chromia, in 2018. The founding team was earlier credited with developing the protocol Colored Coins and Bitcoin Wallet Safebit. The Chromia project is backed by 21M Capital, Neo Global Capital, and Arrington XRP Capital.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>How Does Chromia Work?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Any dApp that operates on the Chromia <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/blockchain-explained/" data-wpel-link="internal">blockchain</a> has its own sidechain that is rooted in and runs parallel to the main blockchain. Chromia places a blockchain inside a database, and for handling voting and consensus, it adds a light software layer. This leads to the creation of nodes that are distributed among various participants. Any request to write data first goes to any of the nodes which share it with the other nodes. A consensus is reached post the inspection of the nodes. In this way, the data is finally logged into the blockchain. </p>



<p>Chromia can be used both as an enterprise and an independent public blockchain. The relational databases provide versatility, flexibility, and consistency to the data and application, making Chromia blockchain a perfect fit for<em> the publicly hosted application infrastructure for the reformed internet, granting sovereignty to the users. </em>Chromia is also an ideal layer-2 to Ethereum as it helps to make transactions cheaper and faster.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Platforms Hosted on the Chromia Blockchain</h2>



<p>The Chromia blockchain hosts several popular applications across a wide and diverse range:</p>



<ul><li>Metaverse-themed P2E games like My Neighbor Alice, Chain Alliance, Mines of Dalarnia, Krstopia, etc.&nbsp;</li><li>Enterprise-level applications like LAC Property Chain &#8211; a land administration initiative in Latin America and the Caribbean, Lingon, CapChap, etc.</li><li>Defi-based options trading platform like Hedget.</li><li>Applications like Green Asset Wallets, Chromunity, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2>CHR Token</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/CHR-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">CHR token</a> is the native token of the Chromia platform and derives its value within the Chromia ecosystem via various utilities.</p>



<ul><li>CHR can be used to pay hosting fees by <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-dapp-security/" data-wpel-link="internal">dApps</a> and developers of other platforms hosted on the Chromia blockchain</li><li>The token can also be used as a reserve by dApps to peg their own native tokens</li><li>It can also be used to pay fees on the dApps hosted on the CHR network</li><li>The token holders can stake their CHR tokens and earn passive rewards</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image.png" alt="Yearly price history of Chromia as per CMC" class="wp-image-24221" width="576" height="316" srcset="https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image.png 844w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-300x165.png 300w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-768x422.png 768w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-211x116.png 211w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /><figcaption><em>Yearly price history of Chromia as per CMC</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Chromia Price Prediction</strong></p>



<p>The token CHR or Chromia’s price in INR is 20.50 as of 01 June 2022. With a slew of use cases and utilities deriving utility for the CHR token, demand for CHR token from the dApps and users of CHR blockchain will increase, subsequently increasing the price of the CHR token in the long run. The Chromia price prediction is optimistic and bullish as Defi gathers enough steam to go mainstream. Buy Chromia in INR <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/CHR-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">here</a>. </p>



<p><strong>Key Metrics of CHR Token</strong></p>



<p>The CHR token is an ERC-20 token with a circulating supply of 567.37 million tokens. The circulating supply was reduced post the burning of 22 million CHR tokens. The maximum supply of the CHR token is 1 billion. The tokens are released on a monthly basis, and the distribution schedule will be extended to 2025 and beyond.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Token Supply Distribution&nbsp;</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-1.png" alt="CHR token distribution" class="wp-image-24222" width="467" height="276" srcset="https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-1.png 597w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-1-300x177.png 300w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/image-1-196x116.png 196w" sizes="(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px" /><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://research.binance.com/en/projects/chromia" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Binance Research</a></figcaption></figure>

<p>Decentralized Science, or DeSci, is the newest Web3 movement aiming to boost modern science. Although it is still in its initial stage, the movement intends to use Web3 resources to revolutionize scientific research, publication, and funding. In this blog, we&#8217;ll go through the basic introduction of DeSci and its relationship with Web3 tools.</p>



<h1>Introduction to DeSci</h1>



<h2>DeSci, in general terms</h2>



<p>In simple words, Decentralized Science, or DeSci, is a significant Web3 movement that seeks to decentralize science. DeSci strives to address substantial scientific research and publication problems by leveraging Web3 tools like <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/is-dao-a-game-changer-for-social-media/" data-wpel-link="internal">DAOs</a>, smart contracts, and blockchains.</p>



<p>DeSci concentrates primarily on two significant movements. First is the actions taken by the scientific community to enhance the process of research funding and encourage sharing of knowledge and information freely. The second emphasizes the crypto movement to regain ownership from centralized organizations and profit-driven middlemen.</p>



<h2>DeSci, in broad terms</h2>



<p>Decentralized Science (DeSci) is one of the latest Web3 movements that have the potential to bring a massive revolution in the field of scientific research. It seeks to use technological applications like Web3 and blockchain to solve scientific research problems. These problems include the difficulty in finding accurate research findings and other related things during the scientific and research processes.</p>



<p>The scientific and research industry can see a massive shift once the global science community fully accepts the DeSci. Knowledge will no longer be an issue and will be accessible to everyone. DeSci strives to bring everyone into the middle ground, improve collaboration between the global science community, and remove intermediaries (like publisher conglomerates) who take unwanted advantages from people.</p>



<p>You won&#8217;t believe that many scientists invest almost 50% of their time in writing research proposals and struggle to get the proper funding for their work. The chances of being successful are also not guaranteed.</p>



<p>Limitation to easy access to scientific findings and information has always been the pain point that has been affecting the scientific community today. Even though &#8220;science&#8221; is hailed as a life-saver, individuals require authorization to access its data. Therefore, the top priority of DeSci&#8217;s mission is ensuring everyone has access to the scientific data whenever and wherever they need it.</p>



<h2>How will DeSci and Web3 work together?</h2>



<ol><li><strong>Smart contracts</strong></li></ol>



<p>The peer-review procedure is a crucial part of the scientific method, yet there are multiple hurdles. The academic publishing sector usually serves as a middleman that brings together scientists willing to perform peer reviews for free with those in need while making large profits.</p>



<p>Making use of <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-are-smart-contracts-and-why-you-need-to-know-about-them/" data-wpel-link="internal">smart contracts</a> can help regulate a peer-review negotiation &#8211; without the interference of the need of a third party.</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Incentivized communities</strong></li></ol>



<p>To encourage scientific communities to exchange, review, and curate various forms of information into resources like &#8220;smart manuscripts&#8221; (which connect open-source data and protocols) and article collections, tokens or NFTs can play a significant role. This might open new avenues for rapid publication, review, and knowledge-sharing.</p>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Fight censorship</strong></li></ol>



<p>Blockchain&#8217;s feature, permaweb, allows users to save data and information for all time and make it available from everywhere at any time and can be used to prevent scientific censorship.</p>



<ol start="4"><li><strong>Verifiable reputation</strong></li></ol>



<p>Today, a scientist&#8217;s &#8220;authority&#8221; and potential to get funding are based on the number of publications they have done.</p>



<p>Using DeSci, scientists can earn NFTs by performing some value functions for their research. For example, they can engage in peer reviews, mentor emerging experts in the area, and freely exchange data.</p>



<p>The NFTs can be used as verifiable evidence to showcase the significant contributions made by scientists in the field of science.</p>



<ol start="5"><li><strong>Ownership</strong></li></ol>



<p>Open Science has been criticized for the possibility of allowing one huge commercial platform to own science someday. In a DeSci ecosystem, different facets of science, like peer review and reputation systems, could be controlled by distinct, specialized communities.</p>



<p>This would reduce the possibility of single platform dominance and assist future-proof research against quickly evolving technology and new threats.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Decentralized Science (DeSci) is a comparatively very &#8220;young&#8221; concept experimenting with cutting-edge technological tools to transform science. However, for DeSci to be successful, scientists must widely adopt its tools in their daily tasks.</p>



<p>The main goal of DeSci should be to provide scientists with all the equipment they require to be productive and successful in their field of work. Everything else comes secondary.</p>

<p>There has been a resurgence in inflation. India&#8217;s annual inflation rate has been rising for the past five months, and it&#8217;s the same situation in many other countries. This has led to an increase in the number of people seeking methods to safeguard their wealth against inflation, and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin appear to be the ideal solution.</p>



<p>Bitcoin has shown to be an effective inflation hedge in the short period, it has been in existence. It has provided booming profits and is even being referred to as digital gold. Recall the days when gold was one of the only commodities individuals used to safeguard their purchasing power against the dwindling purchasing power of fiat currencies.</p>



<p>But why is Bitcoin being recommended as a hedge against inflation, and can it actually balance the depreciating value of conventional currencies?? Let&#8217;s find out.</p>



<h2>Inflation: A Basic Overview</h2>



<p>To put it simply, inflation is the growing cost of goods and services. To put it another way: When prices go up, the purchasing power of the people goes down. As a result, products and services that would have cost less in the past now require more fiat currency to be purchased. For instance, a chocolate bar that cost 20 rupees two years ago is now 30 rupees. Inflation is to blame.</p>



<p>Various macroeconomic and microeconomic factors might contribute to growing inflation in a country. However, most analysts believe that prolonged inflation happens when there is an increase in the amount of fiat money in circulation that does not correspond to the country&#8217;s economic development.</p>



<p>In most countries, the country&#8217;s central bank is in charge of regulating inflation. It monitors the supply of fiat money in circulation and sets credit limitations for the good of the national economy.</p>



<h2>How can a hedging strategy protect against inflation?</h2>



<p>In an ideal world, an inflation hedge would increase in value even as the purchasing power of fiat currency decreases. Gold and real estate have long been typical inflation-protection investments. During periods of inflation, these assets often held their value or even gained in value. You can safeguard your funds against inflation&#8217;s devaluation by investing in these types of investments.</p>



<p>However, there has been a continuous decrease in investor interest in gold. It is still a good long-term investment, but the profits are no longer as high as they once were. In addition, moving and storing it is a hassle.</p>



<p>The real estate market has also been hit hard, particularly in the wake of the 2008 recession. It&#8217;s also quite expensive to get started. Therefore, only a small number of people can afford to do so. To protect themselves from inflation, consumers were obliged to hunt for other assets that may serve as a hedge in the absence of traditional possibilities. This is where Bitcoin comes into play.</p>



<h2>So how can Bitcoin excel in areas where a well-established asset like Gold couldn&#8217;t?</h2>



<p>To keep it simple, I&#8217;ll discuss three primary reasons why Bitcoin is a better hedge against inflation than gold.</p>



<h3>Bitcoin isn&#8217;t bound to any one currency or economy</h3>



<p>Bitcoin, like gold, is not bound to a certain currency or economic system. Neither is it controlled by a limited set of corporations or stakeholders. As a result, it is a worldwide asset class that reflects global demand.</p>



<p>During periods of rising inflation, investors must take on more risk to counterbalance the drop in asset prices. For example, a dividend yield of 3% may be used to augment retirement income. But if inflation is 6%, it&#8217;s not good enough.</p>



<p>S&amp;P 500&#8217;s long-term return is somewhere between 7% and 8% each year, which is barely greater than the current inflation rate. However, the S&amp;P 500 has yielded much more than its average during the past decade. The drawback of these tremendous returns is that the valuations are now considerably higher than they were in the past. In order for investors to obtain a return of more than 6%, there are few alternatives other than investing in US equities, even at higher valuations. But in terms of risk/reward, the stock market in the United States appears to be the best out there.</p>



<p>Bitcoin may be a superior alternative to stocks since it avoids many of the political and economic concerns connected with the stock market. When it comes to diversifying one&#8217;s financial resources away from only domestic sources, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fit the bill.</p>



<h3>Bitcoin&#8217;s supply is finite</h3>



<p>The total number of Bitcoins (BTC) that may be created has been capped at 21 million by an algorithm. As of 2022, there are around 19 million BTC in existence. In other words, within 12 years of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s inception, 90% of the Bitcoin that could be mined is already in circulation.</p>



<p>Inflation happens when the government or the central bank continues to print currency notes at an excessive rate, resulting in an overabundance of money. As defined by economic theory, inflation occurs when the money supply expands at a higher rate than the real output of goods and services. This is because consumers now have more money to spend on the same quantity of items, resulting in an increase in prices.</p>



<p>However, with Bitcoin, pre-set limitations on the amount of Bitcoin in circulation ensure that there is no excess supply, which helps to keep inflation in line. In addition, the digital coin&#8217;s yearly mining reward drops by 50% every four years on average. With the current supply plan, Bitcoin&#8217;s yearly production rate is around half of gold&#8217;s and is expected to continue to decline, making it more valuable and making it more difficult to get.</p>



<h3>Bitcoin is a convenient means of storing value</h3>



<p>Bitcoin, like gold, is durable, readily interchangeable, safe, and limited in supply, much like gold. However, Bitcoin differs from gold because it can be carried, transferred, and is arguably more decentralized. The majority of the world&#8217;s gold supply is held by sovereign states such as the United States, China, Germany, and other European countries. In theory, anyone in the world may keep and secure their Bitcoin considerably more readily than gold.</p>



<p>Those who believe gold is a valuable metal and Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme may claim that the two are indistinguishable from each other. However, Bitcoin&#8217;s blockchain technology can be put to use in real-world scenarios. As a currency, Bitcoin has few practical uses in industrialized countries with relatively stale fiat currencies of their own. However, in nations prone to hyperinflation and political unrest, Bitcoin is a superior medium of exchange.</p>



<h2>So can Bitcoin work as a hedge against inflation?</h2>



<p>I say Yes. Statistics show that Bitcoin has performed far better against inflation than assets such as gold, real estate, and equities.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re looking to hedge against inflation, Bitcoin is a great choice, but you&#8217;ll need to keep an eye on things like the regulatory landscape. When compared to traditional assets like gold, real estate, equities, and so on, the odds are much better when holding value in Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Underlying qualities such as restricted supply and decentralization drive Bitcoin to a privileged situation as an asset that can keep inflation at bay.</p>

<p>Few could have predicted how significant a brand name followed by a strange-looking &#8220;.com&#8221; extension would be to every company a decade earlier. It wasn&#8217;t long before thousands of dollars were transferred between firms that were slow to adapt and others that were quick enough to jump on the bandwagon and acquire the most popular names.</p>



<p>The contours of Web 3.0 have begun to take shape, and momentum is on the rise as blockchain and crypto become more known aspects of our collective lexicon. Bitcoin, Ethereum, NFTs, DeFi, and many other blockchain-related terms are becoming commonplace. A forward-thinking organization will ask itself, &#8220;What&#8217;s next?&#8221;</p>



<p>One potentially important aspect of Web 3.0 may be Ethereum Name Service domains (ENS Domains). Similar to how web 2.0 IP addresses became easier to traverse with the growth of domain names, the Ethereum blockchain&#8217;s ENS Domains offer a much smoother link between you and your consumers and business associates.</p>



<p>One of the major issues that computer scientists encountered in the early days of the internet was that domains and internet protocol addresses had not been linked up, making them unattractive to the average user. That meant that if you wanted to access a website, you had to enter the whole IP address of the site, such as 54.235.191.121. Because IP addresses are merely strings of numbers and dots that are lengthy and difficult to memorize, it makes browsing the web difficult.</p>



<p>However, in 1983, Paul Mockapetris, an American computer scientist, invented the Domain Name System (DNS) in response to cutting-edge research conducted by Elizabeth Feinler, an American scientist, in the 1970s. The DNS system associates IP addresses with human-readable domain names. Instead of entering an IP address, you may just put wazirx.com into your browser&#8217;s search box and be directed to the website.</p>



<p>Despite all of the technological wizardry taking place in the crypto sector, cryptocurrencies continue to rely on a system similar to the traditional IP address setup.</p>



<p>If you wish to transfer bitcoin to someone else&#8217;s address, you must use that person&#8217;s wallet address rather than something more human-friendly, such as the wallet owner&#8217;s name.</p>



<p>This is where Ethereum Name Service (ENS) comes into play.</p>



<h2>What exactly is Ethereum Name Service?</h2>



<p>The Ethereum Name Service is a decentralized, open, and extensible name system that works with the Ethereum blockchain.</p>



<p>The role of the ENS is similar to that of the DNS in that it maps human-readable names such as &#8220;Rahul.eth&#8221; to machine-readable names such as wallet addresses such as &#8220;8g978dl39ji9xl.&#8221;</p>



<p>Users may buy and administer their own domains via the ENS, allowing for safe and decentralized transactions without the need for long and complex addresses. It also decreases the possibility of typing mistakes while entering the recipient&#8217;s address to send payments.</p>



<p>The ENS may sound similar to the DNS system built in the 1980s, but its design is vastly different.</p>



<p>The ENS, like the DNS, employs a hierarchical naming system known as domains, with the creator and owner of the domain having total control over the top-level domain and subsequent subdomains.</p>



<h2>Components of the ENS</h2>



<h3>Registry</h3>



<p>To begin, every domain name registered in the ENS has an owner. An owner owns a named domain and can transfer it to a new owner at any time.</p>



<p>The owner who wishes to purchase a domain is referred to as a &#8220;registrant&#8221; since he must register the domain with the ENS. The &#8220;registry&#8221; function of the ENS is in charge of recording, monitoring, and tracking who has registered for a domain &#8211; the registrar.</p>



<p>&#8220;Registrars&#8221; are smart contracts that assign subdomain domains and are managed by the permanent registrar, which is the primary registrar. They can be changed at any time or level inside the ENS and can be referred to by the registry&#8217;s owner.</p>



<p>A domain registration registrant can also migrate his registration to another account. Furthermore, if the individual chooses to restore a certain domain name, he can do so by reclaiming that name and domain.</p>



<p>This transfers ownership of the ENS name back to the registrant who reclaimed a specific account.</p>



<h3>Names</h3>



<p>Ownership of a name vs. ownership of registration is different. The ENS uses a &#8220;name&#8221; to identify a specific domain, such as &#8220;john.eth&#8221; which can be made up of a variety of labels separated by dots.</p>



<p>The &#8220;namehash&#8221; algorithm is used to process domain names published on the ENS. ENS uses the name hash to replace human-friendly names with 256-bit cryptographic hashes since the ENS can only work with that many human-friendly names. Using a name hash, the hash may be derived from the name while still maintaining the domain&#8217;s hierarchical features. For example, the name hash for &#8220;john.eth,&#8221; is 0x787192fc5378cc32aa. Representing names in this manner is exclusive to the ENS.</p>



<p>For the name hash to be effective, first and foremost, both upper- and lower-case names must be normalized. This is crucial because the name hash procedure guarantees that all users get the same representation of the names and domains accessible on the ENS.</p>



<h2>DNS vs. ENS</h2>



<p>Both the Domain Name System and the Ethereum Name Service are protocols that specify how certain Web2 and Web3 operations should be handled. The DNS translates the web server&#8217;s IP address into a human-readable string known as a URL.</p>



<p>The Ethereum Name Service translates an Ethereum address into a human-readable string structured similarly to a URL. In this regard, they are both comparable to a phonebook. You can look up a name in a phone book and receive the phone number for that individual.</p>



<p>The DNS is part of a network of internet protocols that allows Web2 to function properly. Web3, a concept that describes the upcoming decentralized version of the internet, is still in its early stages and faces challenges such as lengthy wallet addresses.</p>



<p>For the time being, the primary goal of ENS is to provide individuals and apps with a simple way to read and distribute crypto addresses, as well as to make Web3 more edible. More protocols will most likely be established on ENS as Web3 evolves.</p>



<h2>Why is ENS an important innovation?</h2>



<p>Because the ENS was created for Ethereum smart contracts – and is unique to the Ethereum environment – it doesn&#8217;t suffer from security vulnerabilities experienced by a DNS system. A centralized server stores DNS records for domains and names. That implies they are prone to hacks.</p>



<p>For example, in October 2020, Google&#8217;s threat research team tracked a record-breaking 180,000 assaults against DNSs and other network targets undertaken by Chinese internet service providers.</p>



<p>Alternatively, ENS records cannot be erased and are safeguarded by the Ethereum blockchain.</p>



<p>In addition, the ENS makes names and addresses more visible and more approachable. Anyone can create or register a &#8220;.eth&#8221; domain by participating in an auction process. The highest offer will obtain the domain name, allowing the victor to build subdomains as well as lease the domains.</p>



<p>This provides Ethereum blockchain users with a one-of-a-kind chance to establish a shop on the Ethereum network and become a distinct point of contact amid a sea of addresses.</p>



<h2>How Do You Get An ENS Domain?</h2>



<p>The process for registering an ENS domain name is basic. Users must first install a suitable wallet, such as MetaMask, by downloading and installing the required extension on their preferred browser. Users must also have enough ETH in their wallet to cover transaction fees and the yearly charge for the .eth domain. The following are the steps to registering a domain name:</p>



<ul><li>Users should launch an Ethereum-compatible browser, either by downloading the MetaMask plugin or by using specialized browsers such as Brave or Opera and link their wallets. The official website has a list of supported extensions and browsers.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The user should then go to the ENS DApp and search for the required name or address. If the name has previously been registered with another wallet, users will see a page with information such as the registrant&#8217;s address and the name expiration date. If the name is available, users will be sent to a page that requests the registration term as well as the amount of ETH necessary to register the name.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Users can then select their preferred registration term and view the associated annual fee. The minimum registration time is one year, which users can always extend if desired.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Users can begin the registration procedure after selecting a registration period. Users will be required to sign two transactions: one for the registration request and one for the actual registration. They must confirm the transactions in their wallet and pay the appropriate gas fee. After verifying the initial transaction, users must wait for the blockchain to validate the transaction.</li></ul>



<ul><li>After the blockchain validates the transactions, users must wait one minute to guarantee that no one else is attempting to register the name at the same time. If no one else has registered the name, users may ultimately register it by signing the second transaction and waiting for blockchain verification.</li></ul>



<h2>Closing Note</h2>



<p>ENS is a DApp that connects addresses with human-readable names. It runs on smart contracts from the registry, registrar, and resolver. Smart contracts monitor, store, and serve data. The service was created by Nick Johnson, an Ethereum software developer, and Alex Van de Sande, an Ethereum user experience designer. Since its inception, the ENS system has provided several benefits, including fewer errors, immutability, an easy-to-use name lookup system, and the potential for profit from the buying and selling of ENS-registered names.</p>

<p>To get access to the arena, one must first put their wager in tokens before being paired with a deserving opponent to fight.</p>



<p><strong>Step 4: Be aware of the candles</strong></p>



<p>You need to compete against the clock in real-time price predictions because the quicker you guess, the more points you get.</p>



<p><strong>Step 5: Cleverly use your magic spells</strong></p>



<p>Use your prophets&#8217; magic spells strategically to deceive your enemy and get the upper hand.</p>



<p><strong>Step 6: Build your Crypto Prophecy</strong></p>



<p>To win the complete wager and start creating your own Crypto Prophecy, you must defeat your enemy in the combat arena.</p>



<h2>How do The Crypto Prophecies work? (A comprehensive detail)</h2>



<p>Each player wagers their tokens before starting their fight with another player in a battle. The battle revolves around predicting how each 10-second candle will close, with the winner getting the upper hand to attack their opponent.</p>



<p>Players control &#8220;Prophets&#8221; with the ability to use &#8220;Magic Items,&#8221; which are all in the form of <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-do-nfts-get-their-value-do-they-also-get-overvalued/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFTs</a>. Then, they can improve their skills by combining various Magic Items with Prophets of multiple tiers. To acquire a higher-tier prophet, you must burn a certain number of NFTs.</p>



<p>In addition to these game formats, a daily draw is also conducted. A player receives a ticket for each match depending on the wager made and other variables. As a result, a player has a greater chance of winning in the daily prize draw if they play more games and risk more money.</p>



<h2>What is the TCP token?</h2>



<p>Like many other in-game cryptocurrencies, the TCP token is definitely a fungible token that drives the internal economy of The Crypto World. Since the TCP token adheres to the ERC-20 token standard, all TCP tokens in The Crypto Prophecies have the same value. The integrity of The Crypto Prophecies economy and the regulation of all wagers, purchases, and other uses of the TCP token are all ensured by this standardization of token value.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Do you know &#8211; The Crypto Prophecies creators have an in-game (Hot) Wallet for the players?</p></blockquote>



<h2>Benefits of integrating an in-game Wallet</h2>



<p>The in-game <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/different-kinds-of-crypto-wallets/" data-wpel-link="internal">(Hot) Wallet</a> integrated into the &#8220;The Crypto Prophecies&#8221; enables the players to buy their TCP tokens on any Plygon or Ethereum exchange and transfer them to their in-game Wallet to use them seamlessly.</p>



<p><strong>Zero transaction fees</strong></p>



<p>Are you fed up with rising charges and poor transaction speeds? By leveraging the in-Game Wallet, the Crypto Prophecies can provide quicker loading times, fewer transaction approvals, and a quicker, more seamless gameplay experience. In addition, the in-Game (Hot) Wallet can also offer zero transaction fees for forthcoming free-to-play game modes.</p>



<p><strong>Cross-chain support</strong></p>



<p>Isn&#8217;t it the best part? Regardless of where the players have bought their TCP, users can compete against other players. In a real cross-chain solution, Polygon players can quickly load up their TCP and compete against other players who bought their TCP on the Ethereum network.</p>



<h2>Curtain thoughts</h2>



<p>The Crypto Prophecies amalgamates gaming with cryptocurrency and NFTs, providing a more story-driven price prediction experience. Although it appears to be a simple profit-earning game, it also employs gamification to teach the principles of reading candle charts, which are crucial in the crypto world.</p>



<p>The idea is undoubtedly quite intriguing, with a distinctive art style and story being constructed around it. The Crypto Prophecies could be among the greatest games available in the field as interest in NFTs and blockchain gaming is set to rise to new heights in the coming future.</p>

<p>DDoS assaults are closely tied with botnets, in which hackers acquire command and control of thousands of Internet-connected devices and then instruct all of those devices to make requests to the target at the same time in coordinated attacks. However, in recent years, hacktivist groups and criminal organizations have increasingly begun to deploy attack tools that are easy to get and use. These DDoS assault apps, such as WebHive LOIC, began as tools for cybersecurity experts to use to do &#8220;stresser&#8221; testing on websites. They can&#8217;t launch a significant DDoS assault when running in a solitary instance. When several stressor apps are coordinated together, whether through a botnet or a cloud service, these attack tools may knock down big commercial websites for extended periods of time.</p>



<p>The cryptocurrency space is not strange to such cyber-attacks, and more than one platform has fallen prey. To better understand how these attacks transpire, let&#8217;s take a look.</p>



<h2>What Exactly Is a DDoS Attack?</h2>



<p>A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a sort of cyberattack that floods a system, such as a network or a web server, with requests in an attempt to bring it down. When traffic exceeds the server&#8217;s capacity, it is unable to respond to valid requests from legitimate users, resulting in &#8220;denial of service.&#8221;</p>



<p>DDoS attacks use multiple devices cooperating on a network to overwhelm the server with traffic that exceeds its capability. They are frequently carried out by bad actors on large businesses on which people rely for important services, such as banks, news websites, and, in certain cases, power plants. The true objective might also range from robbery and extortion during system outages and downtime to the initiation of subsequent assaults such as phishing and ransomware, reputation harm, or simply inciting anarchy.</p>



<h2>How DDoS Attacks Work</h2>



<p>In order to carry out a DDoS assault, the attackers need a network of machines that work together under their control. A botnet is a collection of infected devices that sends a flood of malicious traffic to a designated destination.</p>



<p>Laptops, mobile devices, PCs, servers, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices are examples of machines that might be dispersed across a broad radius. In a botnet, these devices may number in the tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands. By exploiting security flaws and injecting malware into the devices, attackers may have gained access to the users&#8217; personal information without their knowledge.</p>



<p>The 2016 Dyn assault, which took down much of the internet service in the United States and crippled sites including Twitter, the Guardian, and Netflix, was one of the largest and most well-known DDoS attacks. A botnet of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, including cameras, televisions, printers, and even baby monitors, was utilized in this operation to deploy the Mirai malware.</p>



<p>A DDoS attack is launched in the following manner. To begin with, malware infects a device, allowing an attacker to gain control of it. Once a botnet has been set up, customized attack instructions may be delivered to each bot through the web. When a network or web server is the target, each bot sends requests to the server&#8217;s IP address.</p>



<p>Since each bot is a genuine device on the internet, traffic from the bot seems regular and, therefore, difficult to differentiate from real traffic to the server.</p>



<h2>The Different Types of DDoS Attacks</h2>



<p>Despite their simplicity, DDoS attacks can come in numerous kinds depending on the tactic utilized. DDoS attacks often fall into one of the following categories.</p>



<h3>Networking layer or Protocol attacks</h3>



<p>These DDoS attacks are aimed at the infrastructure of the network itself. They may, for example, transmit slow pings, faulty pings, and incomplete packets to sections of the network responsible for confirming network connections. Security measures such as firewalls are not sufficient to protect against this form of DDoS.</p>



<p>Furthermore, firewalls may be installed further into the network, which implies routers might be compromised before traffic reaches the firewall. Common forms of network layer attacks include the Smurf DDoS and SYN flood attack, which makes a TCP/IP connection request without finishing it and keeps the server waiting for an acknowledgment (ACK) packet which doesn&#8217;t arrive. The severity of the networking layer or protocol attacks is measured in packets per second as they depend on the number of packets of information that are sent rather than the actual bits.</p>



<h3>Application layer attacks</h3>



<p>A DDoS attack of this sort is aimed at disrupting the functionality of applications rather than the infrastructure that supports them. They can be launched over HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, or SMTP and attack the L7 layer of the Open Systems Interconnection Model (OSI). The attacks are aimed against the layer of the server that generates and delivers web pages in response to HTTP requests. Examples of application layer attacks are HTTP flood, Low and Slow, and BGP hijacking. These are evaluated in requests per second since the intensity of the attacks relies on how frequently or continuously the botnet traffic seeks access to the app services.</p>



<h3>Volume-based traffic attacks</h3>



<p>Volume-based DDoS attacks rely on overwhelming the network&#8217;s capacity with data. Frequent volumetric attacks include floods of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and ICMP messages. In UDP flood attacks, attackers exploit the UDP format to circumvent integrity checks and perform amplification and reflection attacks.</p>



<p>Volumetric DDoS attacks can include DNS amplification attacks, in which the attacker sends a request to a DNS server with an IP spoofing address (of the target server) in order to amplify traffic to that server. Attackers use ICMP floods to disable network nodes by flooding them with bogus error requests. The attacker&#8217;s objective here is to submit as many queries as possible in a short period of time from as many infected devices as feasible.</p>



<p>DDoS attacks can also be classified by their desired consequences. Some are designed to flood, while others are designed to crash.</p>



<h3>Flooding DDoS attacks</h3>



<p>The objective of these attacks would be to bring down a server by flooding it with massive amounts of data. Data packets are sent in an attempt to take down a network of computers, such as an ICMP flood or ping flood. The SYN flood mentioned above under networking layer attack acts similarly.</p>



<h3>Crashing DDoS attack</h3>



<p>In this sort of DDoS attack, the attacker transmits bugs to a hacked system in order to exploit flaws in the system&#8217;s infrastructure. An unpatched router or firewall is vulnerable to attack and crashes the system, exposing the faults that can be exploited.</p>



<h2>Techniques to Prevent DDoS Attacks</h2>



<h3>Reduce Attack Surface Area</h3>



<p>One of the initial strategies to reduce DDoS attacks is to decrease the surface area that may be attacked, thereby reducing the opportunities for attackers and allowing you to implement defenses in a single spot. In other words, we don&#8217;t want our application or resources to be exposed to ports, protocols, or other apps from which no contact is expected. We may now focus our mitigation efforts on reducing the number of probable attack points. Using Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) or Load Balancers, you may be able to limit direct Internet traffic to specific sections of your infrastructure, such as your database servers, in some instances. To restrict access to your apps in such instances, you can employ the usage of firewalls or Access Control Lists (ACLs).</p>



<h3>Plan for Scale</h3>



<p>The ability of bandwidth (or transit) and server capacity to absorb and mitigate large-scale volumetric DDoS attacks are the two most important aspects of mitigating these attacks.</p>



<p><strong>Transit capacity</strong></p>



<p>When designing your apps, be sure your hosting provider has enough bandwidth to handle big levels of traffic. Since the ultimate purpose of DDoS attacks is to disrupt the availability of your resources/applications, you should place them not only adjacent to your end users but also to significant Internet exchanges, which will provide your users easy access to your application even during high levels of traffic. As an additional layer of network infrastructure, web applications may leverage Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) and smart DNS resolution services to serve content and resolve DNS requests from locations closer to your end-users.</p>



<p><strong>Server capacity</strong></p>



<p>Most DDoS attacks are volumetric, which means they consume a large number of resources. Being able to increase or decrease compute resources swiftly is therefore critical. Greater computing resources or those with capabilities like more extensive network interfaces or better networking supporting larger volumes can also be used for this. Additionally, load balancers are used to constantly monitor and redistribute loads amongst resources so that no one resource is overloaded at any given time.</p>



<h3>Know what is normal and abnormal traffic</h3>



<p>Many tech firms have a basic policy to only allow as much traffic as a host can manage without negatively impacting availability during periods of heavy traffic. This is known as rate limiting, and it&#8217;s a common practice. A step further in protection can be taken by evaluating individual packets and only accepting traffic that is valid. To accomplish this, you must be familiar with the characteristics of good traffic that the target typically receives and be able to compare every packet to this baseline.</p>



<h3>Deploy Firewalls for Sophisticated Application attacks</h3>



<p>You should employ a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to prevent attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site request forgery from exploiting vulnerabilities in your application. You should also be able to simply develop bespoke mitigations against malicious requests that may disguise themselves as legitimate traffic, come from rogue IPs, or unexpected locations. It may also help mitigate attacks by studying traffic trends and creating tailored defenses with skilled support.</p>



<h2>Closing note</h2>



<p>DDoS attacks have been shown to be a reliable method of bringing down web-based services. Although mitigation and prevention methods have improved, DDoS attacks will continue to be a problem for enterprises of every size. An excellent place to start is a mindset of privacy and security, starting with encrypted email and adopting good online security/privacy practices. This decreases the risk of your devices converting into a bot that contributes to DDOS attacks.</p>

<p>Bull and bear markets are frequently used to characterize the condition of the market, regardless of whether it&#8217;s the stock market or the cryptocurrency markets. Generally speaking, a bull market is one in which prices rise, while a bear market is one in which prices fall.</p>



<p>Bullishness is the belief that an asset or asset class, or even a project, is going to grow in value. Bearish, on the other hand, refers to low expectations for a certain financial asset. Bullish people are referred to as &#8220;bull&#8221; or &#8220;bulls&#8221; if a group or faction of the market is bullish. Therefore, &#8220;bears&#8221; expect asset values to decrease.</p>



<p>Why use bulls and bears as metaphors? The explanation may lay in the way both animals hunt. Bulls attack by forcing their horns up through their target. On the other hand, bears attack from the top down with their weight and arms.</p>



<p>According to Investopedia, this interpretation of the terminology&#8217;s origins is only one possibility. &#8220;The origins of these expressions are unclear.&#8221; The phrasing may also emerge from bearskin transactions ages ago.</p>



<p>Bullish is defined in the Oxford Learner&#8217;s Dictionary as &#8220;feeling confident and positive about the future&#8221; or &#8220;causing, or connected with, an increase in the price of shares.&#8221;. Conversely, bearish indicates &#8220;showing or expecting a fall in share prices.&#8221;</p>



<h2>So, what is a bull market?</h2>



<p>A bull market, or bull run, is described as a period of time in which the majority of investors are buying, demand surpasses supply, market confidence is high, and prices are rising. Any market that sees prices rapidly rise might be the beginning of a bull market.</p>



<p>Bulls are investors that believe prices will rise over time. An increase in investor confidence creates a positive feedback loop that attracts further investment, resulting in an increase in pricing.</p>



<p>Because public confidence in a particular cryptocurrency has a significant impact on its price, some investors employ an approach known as &#8220;market sentiment&#8221; to gauge investor optimism in a certain market.</p>



<h2>When does a bull market come to an end?</h2>



<p>Even in a bull market, there will be ups and downs and corrections. It is possible to misread short-term declines as the end of a long-term uptrend. Because of this, it&#8217;s crucial to look at any possible signals of a trend reversal from a longer-term viewpoint, looking at price activity over longer periods of time. The term &#8220;buying the dip&#8221; is commonly used by investors with a shorter time horizon.</p>



<p>Bull markets don&#8217;t persist forever, and investor confidence will begin to collapse at some time – this might be sparked by anything from negative news like unfavorable legislation to unanticipated circumstances like the COVID-19 pandemic. A bear market can begin with a dramatic decline in prices, which leads to a downward cycle as more investors sell to protect themselves from future losses.</p>



<h2>What is a bear market?</h2>



<p>The term &#8220;bear market&#8221; refers to a period of time in which supply outweighs demand and prices decline. Investors who believe that prices will continue to decline are known as &#8220;bears.&#8221; Trading in bear markets may be challenging, especially for those without much prior expertise.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s impossible to forecast the end of a bear market or the lowest price since recovery is generally delayed and unpredictable, impacted by external variables like economic growth, investor psychology, and international events.</p>



<p>However, they may also be a game-changer. Buying in a down market may pay off in the long run if your investment strategy is long-term in nature. Short-term investors should also be on the watch for price increases or decreases that are just transitory. Then there&#8217;s short selling, which is a technique to gamble that an asset&#8217;s value is going to fall in the future. Dollar-cost averaging is another popular crypto investment strategy that involves investing a certain amount (say $50) every week or month, regardless of the asset&#8217;s performance. This allows you to invest in both bull and bear markets, distributing your risk.</p>



<h2>Purposefully Bearish</h2>



<p>A variety of factors influence investors&#8217; bullish and bearish inclinations. As long as a market or asset can be traded in both directions, traders tend to care less about the direction of the market or asset (called going long and short). Investors, on the other hand, generally hold positions for longer periods of time.</p>



<p>A trader may be more concerned with whether they are correct in their bullish or bearish evaluation rather than hoping for bullishness or bearishness and profiting on trades as long as they are accurate in assessing the direction of a particular asset, depending on the trading tactics employed. However, some traders may have a preference for one market scenario over another.</p>



<p>On the other hand, investors acquire and maintain positions for extended periods of time, earning from the price growth; therefore, they logically favor positive markets. If an investor is bearish on an asset, he or she may take a long-term short position or sell it, but the most anybody can gain (in almost every situation) is a 100% profit if they short it at its absolute top and ride it to zero. But assets have practically limitless potential for price appreciation, making higher gains realistically attainable in certain circumstances.</p>



<p>Why would an investor or trader want Bitcoin (BTC) or any other cryptocurrency to fall in value, even if they are bullish on the crypto sector as a whole? Possibly their position. In the event that a trader is bearish about BTC&#8217;s future price movements, they may establish a short position on the asset and, as a result, want the price of BTC to drop.</p>



<p>There are traders who are long-term bullish, as well as those who are short-term bearish. For example, they may anticipate that Bitcoin&#8217;s price would backtrack for a few days or weeks but then rebound and resume its upward, multi-month trend.</p>



<p>Additionally, short-term investors and traders may want lower prices in order to acquire particular assets at a lower price in the near future. On the other hand, a trader may have a bullish short-term outlook but a bearish long-term outlook. Short-term speculation can lead them to buy or go long, but they expect to eventually sell their holdings because they feel the market is a bubble or something of that sort.</p>



<p>The definition of short-term and long-term in the financial markets can be subjective, so it&#8217;s crucial to keep this in mind.</p>



<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>



<p>A person&#8217;s bullish or bearish outlook is typically influenced by several factors, including charts, news, and general knowledge. A trader may believe Bitcoin or an altcoin is bearish based on specific chart parameters.</p>



<p>They may also be pessimistic about assets after unfavorable developments, such as a specific government regulatory action. On the contrary, one could be bullish for a while due to an approaching event that might be a big deal for the asset that the individual has invested in, for instance, the Bitcoin halving.</p>



<p>Thus, numerous things influence bullishness and bearishness. Timeframes, views, opinions, and events may all influence an asset or asset class&#8217; outlook. Ultimately, each person must decide for themselves what they perceive.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Still not clear? Worry not; let&#8217;s learn about this concept in this blog and how it will function.</p>



<p>Before we jump on to Web5, first, let&#8217;s get a quick overview of Web2.0 and <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-web3-for-beginners/" data-wpel-link="internal">Web3</a>.</p>



<h2>What is Web2.0 &#8211; The social web?</h2>



<p>Web2.0 doesn&#8217;t specifically relate to any internet technology advancements. It just refers to a change in the way people rely on the internet in the twenty-first century. In this present era, the extent of information exchange and connection among individuals has increased. This version allowed users to engage in the experience actively instead of merely consuming the content.</p>



<h2>Advantages and disadvantages of Web2.0</h2>



<p>Technical advancements have made it possible for people to communicate their ideas and opinions with others, which has sparked the creation of fresh ways of networking, organizing, and interacting with others and encouraged a higher degree of collaboration.</p>



<p>However, the internet has several disadvantages as it acts like an open forum. As a result of the growth of social media, there has been a surge in online crimes such as identity theft, cyberbullying, and online stalking. People are also at risk of spreading false information, may it be through social media or some open-source information-sharing sites.</p>



<h2>What is Web3 &#8211; The semantic web?</h2>



<p>The Web3, or the Semantic Web, began in 2010 and signaled the future of the web. By enabling computers to examine data similarly to humans, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) enable the intelligent creation and distribution of helpful information tailored to a user&#8217;s needs.</p>



<p>There are a few differences between Web2.0 and Web 3, but one thing that is common between them is decentralization. The developers of Web3 rarely build or deploy apps that use a single server or keep the data in a single database.</p>



<p>Web3 apps, on the other hand, are constructed on blockchains, decentralized networks of several P2P nodes, or a combination of the two. As a result, these applications are referred to as Decentralized Apps (DApps), and the Web3 community uses that name often.</p>



<p>Coming to the major center of attraction of this blog, i.e., Web5.</p>



<h2>What is Web5 &#8211; The emotional web?</h2>



<p>In simple words, Web5 is a merger of Web2.0 and Web3 to build authorized <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-dapps/" data-wpel-link="internal">Decentralized Apps (DApps)</a> and protocols.</p>



<p>The core vision of Web5 is to let every user have control over their data and restore them without any centralized arbitration. Web5 has the potential to put an end to the web monopoly from the most prominent organizations as it allows acceptance of decentralization for all. TBD, the Bitcoin arm at Jack Dorsey&#8217;s Block, recently declared its desire to develop Web5 on the Bitcoin network to usher in a new age for the internet.</p>



<p><strong>GOAL</strong> &#8211; The main goal of Web5 is to build a unique collection of tools based on Bitcoin that would alter the current financial system. By doing this, investors and people would be able to own and secure their data and control all of their interactions.</p>



<p><strong>PILLARS OF WEB5</strong> &#8211; The founding pillars of Web5 include:</p>



<ul><li>Self-owned identifiers that allow decentralized identity authentication and routing.</li><li>Verifiable credentials as data formats and frameworks for cryptographic presentation and claim verification.</li><li>Decentralized web nodes (data storage and message relay nodes).</li></ul>



<h2>Curtain thoughts: Will Web5 replace Web3?</h2>



<p>It is too soon to consider Web5 as a replacement for Web 3.0. It could be a while before we start to notice the actual consequences of what Web5 is trying to do. This is still only a notion and a proposal at this point, but it has the capacity to disrupt many of the practices we previously thought were &#8220;normal,&#8221; like centralized blockchain networks.</p>



<p>However, things are evolving. There are numerous factors that have harmed the trust of the bitcoin market, including the growth of initiatives that initially advertised decentralized solutions but ultimately turned out to be centralized platforms with single points of failure.</p>



<p>We are currently in the process of shifting from Web2.0 to Web3. However, we might not witness a transition from Web3 to Web5 for some time. Another possibility is that Web2.0 will break into Web3 and Web5, giving developers, businesses, and people more opportunities to choose which form of the internet would function best.</p>

<p>It is likely that you&#8217;ve heard about Web 3.0 and are aware that the internet is on its way to a new decentralized revolution.</p>



<p>Decentralized apps, or Apps, have a great opportunity to grow in the next few years in this environment. It&#8217;s an industry that has already seen tremendous growth in recent years, particularly in 2021, when new use cases like DeFi, NFT, Metaverse, and Gaming have begun to break through to the general public. In addition, the number of users and the amount of money they have locked up on the networks has risen sharply. Ethereum, as the market leader, has more weight than all of its competitors combined, and it appears to be unstoppable.</p>



<p>Ethereum, however, has a major challenge to address, namely the issue of scalability.</p>



<p>The Ethereum blockchain&#8217;s capacity does not allow for a high volume of transactions to be processed per second. Networks get overloaded when more decentralized apps try to trade concurrently. Transaction costs, which rise and fall in line with demand, are becoming increasingly expensive, and a single transaction may now cost upwards of $100.</p>



<p>Although various improvements to Ethereum are planned in the next few years, including the transition to Proof of Stake and the deployment of Sharding technology, these changes will help enhance Ethereum&#8217;s capacity, but it will not be adequate to operate decentralized apps that would be utilized by millions, even hundreds of millions of users in the future.</p>



<p>In 2020 and 2021, more blockchains, including Solana, Binance Smart Chain, and Avalanche, were launched. To increase the number of transactions per second, they&#8217;ve come up with a number of alternative methods, but they have often come at the sacrifice of network decentralization and security.</p>



<p>However, even if these new blockchains can handle up to 100,000 transactions per second, this is not sufficient for large-scale applications. These Blockchains will eventually become overburdened due to an increase in demand.</p>



<p>So, the crypto community has come to recognize that there is likely to be a need to discover a different mechanism for scaling blockchains in the future. It&#8217;s at this point that the modular approach and Layer 2 blockchains like Polygon come in handy.</p>



<p>Polygon, previously Matic, emerged as one of the most promising digital assets in 2021. Many Redditors believe that MATIC is a fantastic cryptocurrency that has the potential to develop much further in the future. There have also been several major partnerships with significant corporations, both in the cryptocurrency industry and outside of it. For the most part, Ethereum proponents have their eyes on Polygon. But why?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before we delve deeper, we must first take a look into why Polygon (Matic) is making headlines. And that&#8217;s not because some big celebrity is talking about it, but purely because of its revolutionary use case.</p>



<h2>What is a Layer 2 blockchain?</h2>



<p>A layer 2 framework or protocol is one that is developed on top of an existing blockchain system. One of these protocols&#8217; key objectives is for major cryptocurrency networks to overcome the problem of transaction speed and scaling issues.</p>



<p>In a broader sense, layer 2 protocols establish a secondary framework in which blockchain transactions and operations can take place independent of the layer 1 framework (main chain). Because of this, these approaches may also be referred to as &#8220;off-chain&#8221; scaling solutions.</p>



<p>Using this novel sidechain architecture, Polygon was created to address some of Ethereum&#8217;s drawbacks, such as low throughput and bad user experience (slow transactions and high speeds).</p>



<h2>Enter Polygon</h2>



<p>The Polygon System employs Plasma to process transactions off-chain before executing them on the Ethereum main chain. With this foundation at its core, Polygon is designed to be a full framework for creating interoperable blockchains. Much more than just a layer 2 solution. But that part is for another article.</p>



<p>By using Polygon, programmers may create pre-configured blockchain networks that have their own unique properties. The increasing number of modules makes it possible for developers to create their own blockchains with specialized functions. These can be further modified if desired.</p>



<p>By now, you might be getting an idea about why everyone is talking about Polygon. It had emerged at a time when the industry was desperately seeking a solution to the scaling woes, and it was the answer. As such, it did not take Polygon much time to get to the limelight.</p>



<p>Polygon&#8217;s design is best described as a four-tier system comprising the Ethereum, security, Polygon networks layers, and execution layers.</p>



<p>The Ethereum layer is simply a collection of Ethereum&#8217;s smart contracts that have been generated on the network. Smart contracts allow Ethereum and various Polygon chains to process transactions, stake, and interact with each other in a secure and efficient manner. Chains may benefit from an additional layer of security by utilizing &#8220;validators as a service.&#8221; with the security layer. It is not necessary to use Ethereum or Security in any way.</p>



<p>Following that, there are two mandatory layers. All additional blockchain networks created on top of Polygon are constructed on top of the Polygon networks layer. Individually, they each have their own community and are responsible for the generation of blocks and the establishment of a local consensus. The execution of a smart contract is handled by Polygon&#8217;s version of the Ethereum Virtual Machine, called the Execution Layer.</p>



<p>Chains built on Polygon can interact with one another as well as with the Ethereum main chain. Polygon&#8217;s message-passing capabilities enable this. This would enable a host of new use-cases, such as interoperable decentralized applications (dapps) and easy wealth transfers between platforms.</p>



<p>Some believe Polygon will be an important part of an ecosystem that will allow for a future when numerous blockchains work together to create a bigger, interconnected network.</p>



<p>Over time, it hopes to contribute toward the creation of a society free of borders in which customers may access decentralized goods and services directly, without having to go through intermediaries or gated communities first. It aims to be a hub where different blockchains may easily plugin while also solving some of their individual shortcomings, such as exorbitant fees, poor scalability, and inadequate security.</p>



<p>There are a number of technologies at work here, including the following ones:</p>



<p><strong>POS Chain</strong>: Polygon&#8217;s primary chain is actually an Ethereum sidechain. This provides Polygon-based blockchains with a proof-of-stake (POS) based security layer.</p>



<p><strong>Plasma Chains</strong>: Polygon uses a scaling method called Plasma to exchange assets between the root and child chains via Plasma bridges.</p>



<p><strong>ZK-rollups</strong>: This is an alternate scaling mechanism that employs zero-knowledge proofs for the main public record on the Ethereum main chain to combine several off-chain transactions into a single transaction.</p>



<p><strong>Optimistic rollups</strong>: This is a blockchain-based solution that allows for near-instant transactions using &#8220;fraud proofs.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to what you may have seen, Polygon intends to incorporate many scaling options in order to keep transaction costs to a minimum in order to minimize barriers to entry. A variety of scaling options is being used by Polygon as a kind of risk mitigation in the event that any one of them fails to meet its objectives.</p>



<p>Polygon has built one of the most popular blockchain networks in the world. The Satoshi standard&#8217;s vision of total and pure decentralization is reflected in this project. It accomplishes this by deploying validators all across the globe, many of whom are security specialists whose job is to monitor and improve the network&#8217;s security and robustness. Due to its dynamic nature, Polygon is capable of virtually instantaneous updates.</p>



<p>Because of how it works, teams can quickly import their apps using Polygon&#8217;s SDK and make them ready for usage across Ethereum for a fraction of the cost of utilizing Ethereum directly. Because of this, Polygon has been picked by some of the most popular protocols. Among these are SushiSwap, Aave, Gains, and many more.</p>



<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>



<p>Polygon&#8217;s adaptability to developer demands has aided it in becoming a market standard. Growth in the crypto-currency market and congestion on Ethereum should encourage developers to continue building on top of Polygon. For now, it is a good option for Ethereum users looking for a solution to transact more quickly and cheaply.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the words of Polygon:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;We envision an open, borderless world. A world in which people and machines collaborate and exchange value globally and freely, without gatekeepers or intermediaries. A world in which communities thrive, unconstrained by artificial borders and archaic regulations. We will strive to empower everyone to effortlessly join this new, better world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

In other words, a recession occurs when the domestic output of goods and services drops. Recessions have occurred in every country to varying degrees of severity, from small slowdowns to the most severe kind of Recession, a depression. About every nine years, a country&#8217;s economy goes through a slump. The Greeks, for example, have been in a technical recession for a quarter of their history since the 1960s. Regardless of the distinctions, it is a certainty that recessions have a detrimental effect on society, contributing to unemployment, decreased income, growing inequality, and an increase in poverty in totality.</p>



<p>Governments are continuously on the watch for indicators of Recession and will use all instruments at their disposal to avert recessions from arising or to mitigate the destructive impact of a recession if one does arise. However, there has been a lot of discussion about whether or not public investment can be beneficial. Recessionary attempts by the government have often backfired, resulting in a worsening economic situation. As a potential alternative to the global financial system, the viability and effectiveness of blockchain-powered cryptocurrencies will be examined in this article.</p>



<p>But first, we must look at the existing countermeasures governments usually employ to battle recession.</p>



<h2>The Usual Tools Against Recession</h2>



<p>Since recessions are a natural component of the economic cycle, little can be done to prevent them. However, governments and central banks may help reduce the impact of a recession by doing the following:</p>



<h3>Fiscal Policy that promotes growth</h3>



<p>In order to boost the economy during a recession, the government will either increase government spending or lower tax rates. Both techniques aim to boost economic activity and increase individuals&#8217; disposable income in order to enable aggregate demand in the economy.</p>



<h3>Expansionary Monetary Policy</h3>



<p>In a recession, the central bank will try to increase the money supply by lowering interest rates and printing more money (officially known as &#8216;Quantitative Easing’). People will be able to spend more money on products and services, which will lead to economic development as a result of the &#8220;flooding”. There are drawbacks to this strategy, as a country with low-interest rates already has very little room to maneuver in terms of monetary policy, especially if printing more money devalues the native currency and hurts foreign commerce. Lately, banks have also been warming to the concept of charging depositors for holding money in the bank rather than paying them with interest growth.</p>



<h3>Government Bailout</h3>



<p>This comprises the use of public funds to avert an institution from collapsing or closing down, owing to the potentially detrimental repercussions. A good example would be the Federal Reserve&#8217;s intervention in the subprime mortgage crisis in 2007.</p>



<h3>IMF Assistance</h3>



<p>Depending on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for, assistance may be the final choice for governments who cannot grow their own resources to alleviate the suffering of their citizens.</p>



<h2>Effects of Monetary Policies</h2>



<p>Monetary policy is the most often used instrument by central banks and governments since it is the quickest to implement. To jumpstart the economy, central banks lower interest rates. This occurred in the years preceding the subprime mortgage crisis, when the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates, producing a low-interest environment that supported huge borrowing and over-leveraging, both of which contributed significantly to the crisis&#8217;s onset. When the global financial crisis struck, the Federal Reserve was forced to lower interest rates even further to virtually zero percent, leaving it with little space to maneuver in terms of monetary policy.</p>



<p>Many nations have considered using negative interest rates to stimulate the economy in the wake of the financial crisis. Among the first to do so after 2014 are Denmark, Japan, Hungary, Sweden, and Switzerland. This &#8216;penalty&#8217; on consumer savings is designed to spur growth and raise inflation. For all practical purposes, preventing the home currency from increasing excessively is intended to raise its competitiveness against foreign currencies. As bad as it may be for those who have funds in a bank, it is regrettable that they endure the weight of it.</p>



<p>Taking note of all the instances described above, we can see these measures are hardly effective and, in turn, hurt the everyday people who are caught in the crossfire. This compels us to ponder whether cryptocurrencies can act as lifeboats during times of economic Recession.</p>



<p>Before coming to any sort of conclusion, let’s take a look at the characteristics of blockchain-powered cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.</p>



<h2>The Bitcoin Lifeboat to survive Recession</h2>



<p>Because of the existing monetary system&#8217;s inherent flaws and inefficiencies, the advent of Bitcoin in the wake of the global financial crisis has given it a fresh identity as a viable alternative. The properties of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies appear better than fiat currency.</p>



<h3>Inflation-Proof</h3>



<p>As a result of rising prices, inflation is the greatest threat to society&#8217;s financial well-being. Inflation, on the other hand, diminishes the long-term purchasing power of our money. 100 years ago, $100 in fiat currency bought a lot more than $100 now. Fiat currency&#8217;s value depreciates over time because of the infinite supply and the capacity of central banks to generate additional money at will. However, with cryptocurrencies, the supply is usually fixed. The total number of Bitcoins in circulation is strictly limited to 21 million (BTC). Fixed-supply money is immune to inflation since its value rises in proportion to an increase in demand and velocity.</p>



<h3>Empowerment</h3>



<p>The decentralization of cryptocurrencies empowers the public, as anybody may participate in the financial system. The criteria for entering and participating in the global financial system are clear and open, with every increment in the money supply being recorded on the public ledger. To put it another way, this is a far cry from the fiat system, where only those at the top of the government and banking organizations know how the money supply grows or shrinks.</p>



<h3>Transparent</h3>



<p>Because they are based on blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies may be accessed by anyone, anywhere in the world, at any time, with no fees or restrictions. This safeguards the financial system against any manipulation or deception.</p>



<h3>Inherently Diversified</h3>



<p>There is no difference in the value of a US dollar in France and China. But it&#8217;s still the currency of the United States, which means it has all the advantages and disadvantages of the American economy. Furthermore, in many nations, it&#8217;s difficult to obtain, store, and utilize in any capacity other than cash.</p>



<p>Because Bitcoin isn&#8217;t tied to a single economy&#8217;s success or failure, it is organically diverse. Rather, it represents wealth without boundaries.</p>



<p>Recessions may spread across countries with common economic interests, as we witnessed in 2008. Although the United States, the European Union, Japan, and many other affluent nations saw economic declines in 2008, several developing countries did grow from 2007 to 2009.</p>



<p>Apart from macroeconomic trends, the price of Bitcoin might fluctuate due to legislation, environmental concerns, government crackdowns on mining, changes in institutional usage, or any number of other variables. However, each of these elements is unique, guaranteeing that the value of bitcoin is not at risk from a single incident.</p>



<p>For instance, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) cracking down on cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) as it strives to regulate financial products connected to cryptocurrencies. This news has a direct impact on Coinbase&#8217;s stock price. However, the price of bitcoin is less likely to fluctuate as a result of such news because the future of bitcoin is not dependent on any one country&#8217;s regulatory policies, not even the United States.</p>



<h3>Secure and globally movable store of wealth</h3>



<p>The scarcity, safety, and portability of Bitcoin all contribute to its value. Bitcoin, like gold, has the qualities of a commodity in that it retains its value regardless of the state of the economy. When compared to stock, Bitcoin&#8217;s growth is not immediately linked to strong industry tailwinds, technical advantages, innovation, financial discipline, or a good management team. Instead, it&#8217;s effective in both booms and busts in the economy.</p>



<p>While Ethereum has more practical uses and perhaps greater upside than bitcoin, bitcoin is better positioned to perform during a recession since it is less volatile. Its objective is not to accelerate the adoption of smart contracts, non-fungible coins, or other applications of blockchain technology. Instead, bitcoin serves as a means of preserving wealth.</p>



<p>Considering these factors, it&#8217;s safe to assume cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, powered by the immense potential of Blockchain technology, could shine as a shelter for the common people looking to shield themselves from the wrath of economic recessions.</p>



<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>



<p>The Bitcoin-led cryptocurrency movement has shown that it is a viable alternative to the fiat currency system. As a means of countering the inherent shortcomings of fiat money and the governments&#8217; inability to manage their own economic and monetary policies properly, cryptocurrencies were developed with qualities like transparency, empowerment, and inflation resistance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fidelity Investments is one of the major asset management and brokerage firms in the United States. Due to its profitability and longevity, it didn&#8217;t feel the need to investigate the digital currency market until investors started taking an interest in cryptocurrencies in the mid-2010s. Midway through October 2018, Fidelity established a limited liability corporation called Fidelity Digital Assets to cater to institutional clients and provide them access to the burgeoning cryptocurrency investing environment.</p>



<p>With this, Fidelity made a significant entry into the digital currency market. Offline cold storage custody, transaction execution, and other services are provided by Fidelity Digital Assets. By leveraging its position as an industry leader, Fidelity Digital Assets plans to aid financial institutions in gaining access to a wide range of digital asset investment options. Why did Fidelity decide to start this new company? This is a question that many investors ask.</p>



<h2>Bullish on Bitcoin</h2>



<p>Bitcoin started slowly in 2015, with a price range of $230 to $280. By October, the coin&#8217;s value had climbed to more than $300. As more individuals were interested in the prospect of a digital asset&#8217;s rising worth, the price of the cryptocurrency began to rise. Bitcoin&#8217;s price surpassed $1,000 in early 2017. Bitcoin&#8217;s popularity skyrocketed, and it quickly became the instrument of choice for many investors.</p>



<p>Individual investors were enjoying 300 percent returns or more on their Bitcoin investments, and institutional investors were salivating because they couldn&#8217;t get into the quickly expanding market. Fidelity, recognizing an opportunity to meet the demands of institutions, determined that the Blockchain Incubator portion of its research and development team should examine and develop cryptocurrency investing solutions for institutional investors.</p>



<p>Fast forward to 2022, and Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity Investments, suggests that, despite Bitcoin&#8217;s current troubles, it may be much cheaper than it appears.</p>



<p>So far, Bitcoin has not had the greatest of years. After a strong start to the year, the price of the largest cryptocurrency on the market is now a faint shell of its former self.</p>



<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s aspirations to recover further were dashed recently when the digital coin&#8217;s price fell to as low as $19,000, a level last seen in 2020. Bitcoin&#8217;s downward spiral, as it usually does, has brought the crypto market down with it, with the whole crypto market value currently around $1 trillion, down from the $3 trillion peak it reached last November.</p>



<p>Regardless of its price performance, Bitcoin may still be undervalued in the eyes of investors, says Jurrien Timmer. Despite the fact that the cryptocurrency has been trading at its lowest level since December 2020, the analyst disclosed that the price/network ratio has returned to 2017 levels.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Is BTC cheaper than it looks? If we consider a simple &#8220;P/E&#8221; metric for BTC to be the price/network ratio, then that ratio is back to 2017 and 2013 levels, even though BTC itself is only back to late 2020 levels. Valuation often is more important than price&#8221;.</p><cite>A tweet by Timmer</cite></blockquote>



<h3>Undervalued</h3>



<p>Traditional stock market investors use the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to determine whether or not a company is over or overvalued. The price-to-network ratio is the cryptocurrency equivalent of this metric.</p>



<p>A high ratio suggests that an asset is overvalued, whereas a low ratio suggests that an asset is undervalued.</p>



<p>Timmer noted that Bitcoin&#8217;s demand curve overlaid with non-zero addresses vs. market value, observing that the &#8220;price is now sitting below the network curve.&#8221;</p>



<p>Timmer then disclosed how technically oversold Bitcoin is, claiming that Glassnode&#8217;s dormancy flow indicator, which indicates the ratio of current market cap to annualized dormancy value, has now reached levels not seen since 2011.</p>



<h3>Oversold</h3>



<p>The macro analyst also provided a graph using Glassnode&#8217;s dormant flow indicator that he says demonstrates &#8220;how technically oversold Bitcoin is&#8221;</p>



<p>Entity-adjusted Dormancy Flow is a popular measure for analyzing Bitcoin&#8217;s worth by comparing the price to spending activity.</p>



<p>According to Glassnode, a low dormancy flow number may signal better long-term holding confidence, meaning that long-term Bitcoin HODLers are buying up from frightened short-term sellers:</p>



<p>&#8220;Glassnode&#8217;s dormancy flow indicator is now to levels not seen since 2011.&#8221;</p>



<p>Similar sentiments were voiced by Morgan Creek Digital co-founder, and YouTuber Anthony Pompliano told Fox Business Monday that Bitcoin&#8217;s &#8220;value and price are diverging&#8221; and that &#8220;weak hands are selling to strong hands:&#8221;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re seeing right now is a shift from weak, short-term oriented people with weak hands to strong, long-term oriented hands.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>In June 2022, Bitcoin&#8217;s Fear and Greed Index plummeted to seven, denoting &#8220;Extreme Fear,&#8221; its lowest level since Q3 2019. Low index numbers mostly indicate a good time to buy.</p>



<p>Both Fidelity Investments and Timmer are bullish on Bitcoin. The investment company has been working on developing a Bitcoin retirement investing scheme that would allow users of 401(k) retirement savings accounts to invest in Bitcoin directly. Timmer also predicted that Bitcoin would make a comeback shortly.</p>



<h2>Betting Big on Crypto</h2>



<p>Fidelity is always focusing on developing innovative solutions for institutional and accredited investors. The company stated in April 2022 that it was developing crypto-enhanced 401(k)s for interested businesses and their employees, which provide exposure to Bitcoin. The custodianship, clearing, and settlement services developed for institutional investors will be used for crypto-enhanced retirement funds. These services offer retirement funds with the institutional-level security and liquidity they require.</p>



<p>Fidelity is also in the lead when it comes to educating investors about cryptocurrencies and the metaverse. It was the first brokerage to offer a metaverse experience. Investors may explore the Fidelity Stack, become acquainted with the metaverse, and learn about investing in Dencentraland.</p>



<p>Fidelity is establishing itself as an industry leader in cryptocurrencies and new technologies by continuing to develop novel cryptocurrency channels and user experiences. Furthermore, it is obvious that the brokerage recognizes that in order to acquire a competitive edge in the emerging digital asset field, it must discover methods to provide its primary clients with the tools to invest in it—and so beat its competitors into the digital space.</p>



<h2>Beyond Fidelity</h2>



<p>Every top institution has jumped on the Bitcoin bandwagon. Even though some of them have sold some of their assets, most of them still have their Bitcoins. JPMorgan, the largest financial services company, recently said that it is bullish on the future of cryptocurrencies, primarily Bitcoin, and also thinks that it is undervalued. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs recently said that it would offer its first-ever Bitcoin-backed loan, which is a big step forward for the company&#8217;s crypto biz.</p>



<p>According to EY, nearly a quarter of fund managers plan to increase their exposure to crypto-related assets over the next two years. In 2021 alone, institutional investors poured a record USD 9.3 billion into crypto markets, which was a 36 percent increase from 2020.</p>



<h2>Creating a favorable climate for cryptocurrency growth</h2>



<p>Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, in general, are obviously gaining institutional traction, but this does not mean that they have reached the institutional mainstream. Many organizations aiming to extend their crypto trading products face significant barriers to entry due to concerns about regulation, trust, and infrastructure.</p>



<p>For institutions to genuinely increase their exposure to cryptocurrencies, CFOs must verify that the proper controls are implemented to provide investor comfort. Greater regulatory clarity is a vital step in this direction.</p>



<p>Some in the cryptocurrency community are vehemently opposed to regulation, claiming that it will stifle innovation and contradict the fundamental decentralized underpinnings upon which cryptocurrencies were formed. Rather than being a barrier to innovation, however, the introduction of a clear and well-developed set of regulations will be critical in incorporating cryptocurrencies into institutional trading venues. Institutions will eventually spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year in the crypto ecosystem, and having confidence in the business through regulation is critical.</p>



<p>The current crypto &#8216;collapse&#8217; is emblematic of the crypto market&#8217;s broader volatility. It is therefore understandable that government agencies like the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have frequently advised consumers that if they invest in cryptocurrencies, they should be prepared to lose money.</p>



<p>These warnings have become a reality in recent weeks and should act as fuel for providing the necessary legislation to make crypto a more orderly and stable industry. Failure to implement the appropriate regulatory framework raises the likelihood that more cryptocurrencies could see a dramatic decline in value in the future, resulting in more losses.</p>



<p>The operational effort required for a fund to get involved in crypto is also considerable. Institutional solutions have gotten more comprehensive, but managers still have a lot of work to do in terms of negotiating issues like valuation rules, compliance, risk management, and incorporating crypto into their investing strategy.</p>



<p>Access to legal, secure exchanges that give clear and real-time market valuations will be critical in addressing these operational problems, giving institutions the toolbox they need to harness and incorporate crypto into their services.</p>



<h2>What comes next?</h2>



<p>Further institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies will likely boost the development of crypto assets as institutions strive to offer decentralized products for their own investor base. This transition is already beginning, with a growing number of financial institutions allowing clients to trade, stake, borrow, and lend against their digital assets.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>StrongBlock (STRONG) is the one and only protocol that rewards nodes for upholding their blockchain&#8217;s infrastructure.</p></blockquote>



<p>Let&#8217;s start our journey to know how strong is the StrongBlock.</p>



<h2>A short introduction to StrongBlock</h2>



<p>The future of the digital world is expected to expand overnight, which is not surprising to those who already belong to the crypto industry. However, a brand-new player on the blockchain is becoming increasingly famous and is called StrongBlock.</p>



<p>StrongBlock strongly believes that the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/blockchain-and-the-future-of-voting/" data-wpel-link="internal">blockchain</a> will be the foundation of the future, but unless you are well-versed in the technical breakthrough, it can be an intimidating place to enter. Therefore, StrongBlock&#8217;s goal is to simplify blockchain for everyone, so people can easily support, adopt, and participate in this technology.</p>



<p>While this short introduction covers a portion of the problem, in this blog, we&#8217;ll get an in-depth overview of what all StrongBlock can bring to the table.</p>



<h2>What is StrongBlock?</h2>



<p>StrongBlock is a Node-as-a-Service (NaaS) platform that makes it possible to build nodes for blockchains of Ethereum (ETH), <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/why-is-polygon-so-hyped/" data-wpel-link="internal">Polygon (MATIC)</a>, EOS (EOS), and other blockchains. The platform helps the users who lack technical knowledge and face challenges in running their own node on blockchains; however, they can also earn rewards through this.</p>



<p>When we talk about consensus, blockchain nodes are equivalent to shareholders in a firm. To enhance the security of the blockchain, nodes filter out multiple spends while validating transactions. Depending on the topology of the blockchain, specific nodes may have more power and the capacity to create blocks. A blockchain is extremely decentralized as it is made up of thousands of nodes.</p>



<p>With more than 15% of all Ethereum nodes under its management, the StrongBlock ecosystem is currently one of the world&#8217;s most effective Ethereum node services. StrongBlock presently hosts close to 2,000 nodes. As a result, users can deposit their ETH and quickly run a node on the system without having to download the complete blockchain. Presently, Ethereum 1.0 is supported, but the platform is getting ready to switch to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) for Ethereum 2.0 in the near future.</p>



<h2>What are Strong nodes?</h2>



<p>A Strong node is basically a node that supports the Ethereum network. It provides a &#8220;Node Universal Basic Income&#8221; (NUBI) to node operators in exchange for the Ethereum blocks they produce to maintain the network. The number of nodes, token price, node income, and ownership of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are all variables that impact rewards; they are only variables and thus are not always guaranteed.</p>



<p>Strong nodes are operated as a service, so they don&#8217;t need hardware. This enables anyone—even non-technical people—to quickly construct a blockchain-compliant node and make money for running it.</p>



<h2>What is a STRONG token?</h2>



<p>The STRONG token, currently known as STRNGR, is an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token that functions on the Ethereum network. The currency is a governance token that serves StrongBlock&#8217;s decentralized system.</p>



<p>To create proper tokenomics for the system, the team burnt around 95% of the 10 million STRONG tokens they produced. In addition, the system keeps burning additional STRONG tokens with every new node deployed to maintain a deflationary token supply.</p>



<h2>How does StrongBlock work?</h2>



<p>StrongBlock provides two primary blockchain node services: Nodes-as-a-Service (NaaS) and Bring-your-own-Node (BYON). The former service is the most popular one as it simplifies the process of creating nodes. The second service is for users who already operate an Ethereum node and want to move that node to the StrongBlock ecosystem to collect STRONG incentives. Both demand a starting investment of 10 STRONG.</p>



<p>The primary distinction between mining on StrongBlock and mining Ethereum using your own node is that users mine STRONG tokens rather than Ethereum.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>The StrongBlock team devised a new strategy to streamline the complex node-operation process. Instead of shelling out thousands of dollars to set up a node system, users can join the current StrongBlock network with a smaller investment and get the benefits of a complete node operator. It is a <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/top-5-altcoins-in-this-bull-run/" data-wpel-link="internal">bullish investment</a> because of the token&#8217;s uniqueness, scarcity, and previous price appreciation. The only risk element is the token&#8217;s performance, which is closely tied to that of the crypto market as a whole.</p>

<p>Gaming has evolved over the years from a simple way to pass the time and distract yourself from the stresses of everyday life to a means by which gamers may be rewarded utilizing blockchain-based technologies like NFTs. In the past, we used to refer to gamers as those who spend their time playing games rather than doing anything constructive. However, that notion has changed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks to the world of video games, a Play-to-Earn model allows players to earn incentives with real-world value. It embraces the notion of an open economy and delivers financial rewards to all players who provide value to the game environment by participating. Gamers may literally &#8220;farm&#8221; or &#8220;collect&#8221; digital assets like cryptocurrency and NFTs, which can then be sold in the open market.</p>



<p>The worldwide gaming industry is anticipated to be worth $268 billion by the year 2025. It&#8217;s safe to say that cryptocurrencies have stepped into this expanding market because they&#8217;ve seen the potential benefits of blockchain technology. NFTs have played a significant part in this growth by helping developers realize that they can generate and transmit real value in the ecosystem.</p>



<p>Even while the gray gaming marketing industry is vast, it does not benefit the developers in any way. Using the game Clash of Clans as an example, many players bought maxed-out bases for a significant sum of money from others who spent their time creating them. Previously, all of these transactions were peer-to-peer. Now with this new emerging technology, a portion of every transaction goes to the developer, benefiting both parties. With the emergence of play-to-earn games, developers benefit from storage safety and data security.</p>



<h2>So, what are these play-to-earn Games?</h2>



<p>These games allow the time spent on playing video games to be monetized. Many of these games have been revolutionized by introducing blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens. Using cryptographic tokens known as NFTs (unique, rare, and individual), we are able to prove the ownership of material such as photographs, drawings, etc. In the same way, they allow us to possess in-game objects. NFTs allow you to own the assets you acquire, like digital items, allowing you to sell them outside of the platform.</p>



<p>There are different ways to acquire these in-game assets, depending on the game you are playing. In addition, some games also offer the ability to reproduce unique NFTs using previously acquired or bought in-game items.</p>



<p>NFT marketplaces may trade and sell these assets or what you would term in-game items. In addition, You may also add scarcity to these items and raise their cost.</p>



<p>Even if you&#8217;re not a gamer, you may still take part in this market because of the unique value and trading opportunities it provides you with.</p>



<p>Some popular P2E games include:</p>



<ul><li>Axie Infinity</li><li>Decentraland</li><li>The Sandbox</li></ul>



<h2>Why has P2E gaming grown so popular?</h2>



<p>You may use economic ideas like demand and supply to explain why P2E gaming has grown so popular (particularly in underdeveloped countries).</p>



<h3>Growth fueled by demand</h3>



<p>P2E gaming, like everything else associated with the metaverse, has been the subject of extraordinary consumer interest (or, to put it another way, demand). It&#8217;s for two reasons in particular:</p>



<ul><li><strong>A significant, ready-made user base:</strong> As a result of widespread unemployment caused by the COVID-19 epidemic, a sizable group of individuals (particularly in developing nations) were unemployed and unable to earn a living. The arrival of P2E gaming (promoted by new-age gaming companies like Axie Infinity) in countries with high literacy, widespread smartphone penetration, and an avid gaming culture like the Philippines attracted these unemployed players who were interested in gaming and were eager to earn money regardless of their interest in cryptocurrencies. As demand for Axie tokens expanded, firms like Yield Games Guild gave additional alternatives for users to get their hands on the tokens, which resulted in a larger client base.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Strong network effects:</strong> Apart from gaming and cryptocurrencies having two of the largest online communities, a key cause for high consumer demand for P2E gaming has been the deep-rooted community that has sprung up around it. More individuals joining Axie (for example) raises the perceived value of being a member of the Axie community (whether online or in-person), which in turn encourages more people to start playing, and the cycle continues. Interestingly, as these gamers not only play together but also exchange NFTs/tokens on these (and other) platforms, their interactions are growing from purely social to also having an economic component, which strengthens the presence and power of the online community. It&#8217;s probable that, with the rise of web3, the connections made through these games may extend to other transactions, such as where to become a virtual landowner and which Guilds to contribute towards, etc., as the players progressively develop their lives online.</li></ul>



<h3>Supply-led growth</h3>



<p>With P2E gaming&#8217;s development being pushed by not just gaming platforms like Axie Infinity and StarTerra, but also auxiliary platforms like Yield Games Guild, major tech corporations like Meta and Microsoft, and smaller tech businesses such as Bitstamp (who make the otherwise prohibitively costly tokens needed to enter the games more reasonable and accessible for new players), P2E gaming is becoming more mainstream. P2E gaming&#8217;s supply ecosystem is becoming increasingly &#8220;full service&#8221; as new players enter and plug-in outstanding holes in the ecosystem, resulting in more frictionless interactions (social or economic) and greater access/participation across geographies, which will, in turn, drive customer demand across not only emerging economies but also developed countries.</p>



<h2>The Success of AXIE Infinity</h2>



<p>P2E game Axie Infinity is based on the concept of digital pet avatars, or Axies, which players may collect and interact with. Played by third-worlders from countries like Venezuela and the Philippines, Axie&#8217;s native crypto-assets—Smooth Love Potion (SLP) and Axie Infinity (AXS)—rose to cultural popularity in 2019 as reports emerged of players making a full-time livelihood off of the game&#8217;s own crypto assets.</p>



<p>With SLP and AXS, gamers may breed their Axies in order to expand their collection. Like other governance tokens, AXS may be exchanged for cash, but they&#8217;re intended to act like shares.</p>



<p>Vincent Gallarte, 25, a Manilla IT worker who was fired, earned 35,000 pesos ($732) in the first two weeks of this game. He made three times as much money playing the game as he did at his previous work.</p>



<p>Three Axies, each costing $200, are required to participate in the game. Students who cannot afford to buy the game have taken advantage of scholarships, where Pangindian has helped students acquire their first Axies and begin playing them.</p>



<p>Another gamer, RK Secreatario, 31, of Nueva Ecija province in the Philippines, who formerly worked in agricultural sales for two years, now earns about $2000 per day, more than double his prior earnings. He makes the money in an hour of gaming and considers it a blessing.</p>



<p>According to the research department of blockchain analytics platform Nansen, 2.8 million unique addresses are now holding 11.1 million Axies, and 97 percent of those users have at least three Axie non-fungible tokens or NFTs.</p>



<p>There has been a lot of discussion about how Axie would benefit from authentication of in-game assets, secondary market trading prospects, and decentralized governance. Nansen&#8217;s research is in line with those previous public evaluations, concentrating mostly on these and other benefits.</p>



<p>Even in developing countries, it is reasonable to infer that P2E gaming models are a big success, given that Axie Infinity has produced $1.3 billion in revenue and $4 billion in transactional volume over the course of the previous year, with a significant portion of its user base in developing nations like the Philippines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This compels me to ask the question, can this success be replicated in India? Yes. Why? Well, there are a couple of factors that make India the perfect market for P2E games.</p>



<h2>A Rapidly Expanding Market for Gamers in India</h2>



<p>Worried when the Covid-19 outbreak struck two years ago, Indian parents of various socioeconomic backgrounds requested their children to refrain from playing video games. It was regarded as a complete and utter taboo at the time. An important victory for the country&#8217;s $930 million gaming industry happened recently when the Karnataka High Court struck down changes to the Karnataka Police (Amendment) Act, aimed at outlawing participation in online games.</p>



<p>Several lockdowns and limitations imposed by the epidemic have altered the complexion of the gaming sector in India, one of the world&#8217;s major markets today. The internet penetration rate in India is believed to be 30%.</p>



<p>Now, the gaming sector is viewed as a significant economic contributor. There might be tens of thousands of jobs created in this new industry. In the coming years, a number of gaming tech startups are likely to finalize their recruiting plans in order to sustain growth.</p>



<p>More than 560 million people in India use the internet, making it the second-largest internet consumer in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In India, mobile phone users make up 85 percent of the sector, followed by PC users at 11 percent and tablet users at just 4 percent.</p>



<p>India&#8217;s gaming sector has grown at a 15 percent annual rate over the previous five years because of the availability of inexpensive cell phones, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF). In addition, the world&#8217;s lowest data tariffs and high-speed 4G internet adoption have made a significant contribution.</p>



<p>Nearly half of India&#8217;s mobile users started playing games on their cellphones during the epidemic, according to a poll by an AdTech business. While the pandemic has closed the doors of opportunity for many, it did, however, affect the gaming industry in a major and positive way.</p>



<h2>Indian Gaming Giants are Betting on Blockchain</h2>



<p>Companies like JetSynthesis, well-known in the gaming industry, have begun exploring the potential of NFTs in games. “We have done some R&amp;D on this and we are deeply looking at some use cases. Some of the things are very obvious, like the NFTs which can be used for skins and avatars,&#8221; said Rajan Nawani, CEO of JetSynthesis. Ludo Zenith is one of the company&#8217;s most popular mobile games, and it has partnered with worldwide gaming heavyweights like Square Enix.</p>



<p>Even the gaming branch of Avisa Ventures, situated in Bengaluru, is collaborating with game developers to build two or three blockchain-based games for its consumers to enjoy. An NFT Gaming Guild and a slew of investments have been made in a variety of initiatives. The guild has also started a &#8220;Play to Earn&#8221; tournament on Axie Infinity for Indian gamers so that they may earn tokens that they can then sell to other players.</p>



<p>Similarly, NODWIN Gaming and RageFan teamed together to give Chess NFTs during the Chess Super League (CSL) competition in October in the eSports sector. RageFan is a Blockchain-based marketplace that sells NFTs and fan tokens for sports and entertainment. It has been announced that RageFan would soon be selling NFTs for the Chess Premier League.</p>



<p>Blockchain-based games account for around 55% of the daily traffic to decentralized applications (Dapps), according to a survey by blockchain analytics firm DappRadar. In October, Dapps achieved an all-time high of 2 million daily unique active wallets globally.</p>



<p>These advancements, according to industry analysts, are a prelude to Web3 games. Decentralized infrastructure and machine-based data understanding are expected to be the driving forces behind Web3, the next generation of the internet.</p>



<p>Homegrown Polygon is sponsoring a hackathon with over $100,000 in prizes to encourage developers to build and demonstrate Web3 apps and games that run on blockchains in India&#8217;s developer community. More than 100 web3 unicorns would be created in India by 2025, according to the crypto business. Dapps using Polygon&#8217;s blockchain networks have witnessed the &#8220;biggest growth,&#8221; according to the DappRadar research quoted above.</p>



<p>In spite of the general optimism about the potential of NFT and blockchain-based gaming in India, many businesses are hesitant to move forward because of the uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency regulation. However, that could soon change as Indian regulators have recently introduced a tax on crypto trading, hinting that future regulations are a possibility.</p>



<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>



<p>Considering the current state of the Indian gaming sector and the willingness of Indian gamers, it is safe to assume that P2E games are a promising sector in the Indian market. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are being considered for use in games and esports, as well as the development of new blockchain-based games, in order to capitalize on the burgeoning interest in crypto and NFTs in India.</p>



<p>Gamers that participate in P2E games in India are rewarded with cryptocurrencies as well as being able to purchase virtual products and real estate using NFTs. NFT games like Axie Infinity, which have millions of players worldwide, are popular in India. Other play-to-earn gaming initiatives, such as Star Atlas and Illuvium, are rapidly gaining traction in the cryptocurrency market, capitalizing on the burgeoning metaverse and NFT worlds.</p>



<p>As a result of the pandemic, eSports and NFT games in India have grown tremendously. A growing number of Indians are playing games on their mobile devices thanks to the widespread use of smartphones, as well as low data costs. Gaming in India is likely to increase exponentially in the future years because of Web3&#8217;s concept of play for money, where players can monetize their time and achievements.</p>

<p>The key difference between Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) is that ETC is a speculative digital asset with a fixed asset. On the other hand, ETH is the most extensively used and accepted version with an unlimited supply. Both emerged from a hard fork when Ethereum Classic was hacked in 2016.</p>



<p>Let’s get into a more detailed discussion about these both cryptos.</p>



<h2>What is Ethereum Classic (ETC)?</h2>



<p>In 2016, when the original Ethereum network was compromised, the blockchain split into two parts, among which one was <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-ethereum-classic/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum Classic</a> and the other was the new Ethereum. Ethereum Classic is an open-source blockchain, and ETC is its native currency that fuels transactions and smart contracts on its network.</p>



<p>In addition to safeguarding the network, the hard fork led to the restoration of all the stolen funds to their rightful owners. Since the split, the Ethereum Classic network has undergone continuous improvements. Ethereum Classic’s fundamental goal focuses on immutability, popularly known as “code is law.”</p>



<h2>What is Ethereum (ETH)?</h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Ethereum.org</a>, “Ethereum is a technology for building apps and organizations, holding assets, transacting and communicating without being controlled by a central authority. There is no need to hand over all your personal details to use Ethereum &#8211; you keep control of your own data and what is being shared. Ethereum has its own cryptocurrency, Ether, which is used to pay for certain activities on the Ethereum network.”</p>



<p>Ethereum is decentralized and accessible to everyone who has internet. Ethereum is a technology that can be used as a digital currency, worldwide payments, and application software.</p>



<p>You can use Ethereum’s DeFi system 24 hours a day, seven days a week, which means you can transfer funds, receive, borrow, and earn interest anywhere, anytime. However, you can also showcase any digital art in the form of an NFT with Ethereum.</p>



<p>Ethereum doesn’t force you to share your personal information, but all you need to have is a wallet. Although, in this internet era, we know somewhere we have to make our private data public.</p>



<h2>How Ethereum and Ethereum Classic are different?</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Immutability</strong></li></ul>



<p>Immutability is a technique where users cannot make changes in the transactions that took place in the blockchain’s history.</p>



<p>Ethereum provides a platform where you can alter the transactions or make adjustments to them. However, Ethereum Classic uses the original Ethereum system that follows the concept of immutability.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Mining process</strong></li></ul>



<p>For mining, Ethereum Classic still uses the Proof-of-Work (POW) system that Bitcoin also uses. To get rewards in the form of Ether, miners must validate transactions on the blockchain.</p>



<p>The new Ethereum has upgraded to a <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-whats-better/" data-wpel-link="internal">Proof-of-Stake (POS)</a> process. Those who validate their transactions invest their stakes in the mining process to get the chance to add a fresh block to the chain and earn a reward.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Limit</strong></li></ul>



<p>Ethereum can have an unlimited supply as and when needed, although the annual growth rate is restricted to 4.5%.</p>



<p>Ethereum Classic has a limited supply of 230 million tokens in total.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Value</strong></li></ul>



<p>As of July 2022, the value of the Ethereum token is $1,088. It is also the second-largest crypto in the market, with a market cap of nearly $129 billion.</p>



<p>On the other side, Ethereum Classic is comparatively smaller, with a token value of $14 and a market cap of $1.9 billion, as of July 2022.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Potential changes</strong></li></ul>



<p>While Ethereum is open to multiple potential future revisions, Ethereum Classic has decided to abide by Ethereum’s initial rules completely.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><a href="https://cdn.wallstreetmojo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Ethereum-vs-Ethereum-Classic-info.jpg.webp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">Image Source</a></p>



<h2>Does Ethereum Classic (ETC) have a future?</h2>



<p>When we look at the future of Ethereum Classic, it doesn’t have a bright future, in all likelihood.</p>



<p>When we compare Ethereum Classic to Ethereum, it is self-evident to say that Ethereum is considered superior to Ethereum Classic. People trust the ETH network as it is more reliable, has more support, and has a greater market cap. Furthermore, as compared to any other smart contract platform, Ethereum has many DeFi platforms and other <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-dapp-security/" data-wpel-link="internal">DApps</a> built on it.</p>



<p>To make the issue worse, the Ethereum Classic network has experienced almost 51% of attacks. This usually happens if an attacker racks up sufficient hashing power to take over the majority of the network. Then, they can make changes in the blockchain, which might cause issues like double-spent transactions, where users can transfer the same coins more than once.</p>



<h2>Bottom line thoughts</h2>



<p>The key differentiating factor between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic is the ideology. The latter is dedicated to maintaining the fundamental code of the original Ethereum network. Those who want to prioritize Ethereum’s unadulterated historical record consider Ethereum Classic a worthwhile investment.</p>

<p>For the most part of the history of home video gaming, games have served as simply a means of entertainment and a way to unwind after a long day at work. However, a new generation of video games is employing blockchain technology such as NFTs to reward players with cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>Bombcrypto is one such P2E game that combines a Bomberman-style gameplay experience with blockchain-based NFT collectibles. Players may collect, fight and trade monsters for real money. The game was developed by Senspark, a Vietnamese independent game development company created in 2011.</p>



<p>Lately, there has been a lot of hype surrounding this P2E game, and it&#8217;s worth taking a look into how the game works and what it has to offer.</p>



<h2>Inside Bombcrypto &#8211; How Can I Make Money With It?</h2>



<p>BomB Crypto was released in 2021 and currently only offers Treasure Hunt mode, a pay-to-win feature in which players may buy and acquire heroes to hunt for BCOIN tokens. If you&#8217;re familiar with the classic gameplay of Hudson&#8217;s Bomberman game, you&#8217;ll recognize the mechanics in this game.</p>



<p>In Treasure Hunt mode, players can send their heroes to mining zones to set explosives in order to demolish blocks and find BCOIN. These heroes may function autonomously without the need for players to continually oversee them, saving time. It&#8217;s worth noting that the hero uses up energy every time a bomb is detonated.</p>



<p>When their energy is depleted, they undergo a resting state to replenish. The energy charging speed will improve if the player acquires an in-game &#8220;house&#8221;. In a way, it&#8217;s semi-passive because characters move around on their own, but you have to manually turn them on after your stamina has been refilled.</p>



<p>Other options include a story mode that will allow players to participate in a structured level format that will entail battling monsters that can drop BCOINs. The other mode is Battle Mode, which allows users to compete against other people. To enter, players must not only have a specific sort of energy, but they must also pay a certain sum of tokens as an entry fee. The final winners receive the majority of the losers&#8217; chips.</p>



<p>To sum it up, the game modes are as follows:</p>



<ul><li><strong>The Arena Battle</strong></li></ul>



<p>Players select a hero to participate in a bomb war with multiple other players. In fight mode, users must spend a set quantity of tokens, and the winner receives the total amount of the loser&#8217;s token. When engaging in fight mode, your hero will also lose some energy.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Managing Heroes</strong></li></ul>



<p>Users may earn new heroes by participating in rescue missions. On some maps, there is a small possibility that users will come upon a prison block with a bomber hero locked inside. After completing the rescue operation, you will be given a depleted hero who must be recovered before being utilized again.</p>



<ul><li><strong>The Story Mode</strong></li></ul>



<p>Bomberland is a serene land where the residents live exceedingly calmly and joyfully. But then a wicked power arrived to attack Bomberland. He damaged woods, detained individuals, and took BCOIN, the people&#8217;s property. To return peace to the nation, the kingdom&#8217;s scientists investigated and constructed heroic characters that could form a team to rescue BCOIN and the people while fighting the armies of evil&#8217;s minions.</p>



<p><strong>The Bomber Heroes</strong></p>



<p>In BombCrypto, each player has a squad of heroes with differing abilities. Each of these characters is an NFT, allowing the player to shift and swap their heroes more freely. Character heroes are classified as common, uncommon, ultra-rare, epic, or legendary. They also have five distinct statistics:</p>



<p><strong>Power:</strong> The hero&#8217;s destructive ability.</p>



<p><strong>Stamina:</strong> The length of time the hero may be active before &#8220;resting&#8221;;</p>



<p><strong>Speed:</strong> The rate at which the bomber moves over the game map.</p>



<p><strong>Bomb Num:</strong> The number of bombs that may be put on the map;</p>



<p><strong>Bomb range:</strong> blast destruction distance</p>



<p>The rarer the hero, the more powerful its stats. Furthermore, each hero can have none, one, or more passive talents, such as regaining more stamina, causing more damage, and many others.</p>



<p>You may develop heroes by eating other heroes using the upgrade feature. The player chooses one hero to enhance and one to discard. In an update, different rarity heroes can be employed, but the level must be the same.</p>



<p><strong>How to Acquire a Bomber Hero?</strong></p>



<p>Hero characters may be obtained in three ways: hero rescue, shop purchase, and market auction.</p>



<p>On some maps, users may earn additional heroes by completing rescue missions. It&#8217;s rare to discover a hero in a jail block, but they do exist. Players can also earn a depleted hero after finishing the rescue mission, which must be restored for a while before being utilized again. Do keep in mind that Prison Blocks may only be found in Treasure Hunt Mode.</p>



<p>Users may also use BCOIN to purchase character heroes from the in-game store; however, the amount of heroes available is relatively limited. New heroes, like those who have been rescued, need time to recover.</p>



<p>Finally, the P2P marketplace allows users to purchase and trade NFT products as well as hero characters. It will assist players in earning in-game incentives and increasing game assets and liquidity. BCOIN is the sole currency in this market.</p>



<h2>What’s BCOIN?</h2>



<p>BCOIN, Bomb Crypto&#8217;s native utility coin, is utilized to play, exchange, and trade on the ecosystem. Furthermore, the token allows token holders to participate in the game&#8217;s development. The token is built on the Binance Smart Chain&#8217;s BEP-20 standard Token holders may earn in-game incentives and VIP status by staking the BCOIN token. These VIP benefits represent an increasing level of incentive for the user. Users can also vote on important governance issues using the token. BCOIN can also speed up hero box opening, which contains reward tokens.</p>



<p>Furthermore, as an in-game token, BCOIN greatly benefits the players. Token holders can use it to obtain tickets to in-game events such as boss and battle royale. Following that, the platform allows holders to establish clans to fight monsters and get energy levels to boost the hero&#8217;s stamina in the game.</p>



<h2>The Team behind Bombcrypto</h2>



<p>Senspark is the gaming firm behind Bombcrypto, a Vietnamese independent game developer formed in 2011. Senspark has released more than 40 games, with over 100 million downloads. Stickman Battle 2021 (18M+ downloads) and All Gold Miner Game (20M+ downloads) have been its most successful titles to date.</p>



<p>Lam Ho, a Vietnamese serial gaming entrepreneur who has led the firm for over ten years, founded Senspark. Senspark employs about 40 people in total. Furthermore, Thai Duong, Google&#8217;s Head of Security, Truong Do, Google&#8217;s Game Industry Manager in South-East Asia, and Eric Vuong, Chairman, and CEO of HVA Investment JSC, are advisers for the P2E game.</p>



<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>



<p>If you want to explore the world of NFT games, namely BombCrypto, you should be aware of the risks involved. These assets, like any cryptocurrency, are volatile, which means their value fluctuates. If there is a problem or if people quit playing, their value will decline, and the long-awaited return on investment may take even longer.</p>



<p>That being said, do your homework before making any investments; investing in cryptocurrencies is extremely dangerous and speculative, so you should come prepared. However, if you are just looking for a casual gaming experience or just want to explore the world of NFT games, you can always give this a try.</p>

<p>As a new crypto investor, keeping your crypto investments secure is one of the most crucial things to consider; therefore, we&#8217;ve put together a security checklist of precautions you should check. This crypto security checklist covers everything from protecting your crypto on your chosen exchanges to safeguarding your accounts from unauthorized access to relocating your assets to secure offline storage.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s not wait further; jump on the bandwagon to read what the security checklist consists of.</p>



<h2>Need for a security checklist</h2>



<p>In the past few years, the crypto market has gained a lot of popularity and has attracted millions of investors. However, scams and <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/crypto-scams-how-to-spot-them/" data-wpel-link="internal">security breaches</a> have always been a part of the financial industry, may it be the traditional banks or the crypto world. The crypto industry has also been exposed to a lot of scams that can result in the loss of funds for crypto investors.</p>



<p>While entering the crypto industry, the new investors should be extra cautious; there are high chances they might be exposed to security breaches and may lose their investment to cyber crimes. Although the cryptocurrencies and tokens are built on highly secure blockchain technology, but as an investor, one should always remain cautious and beware of the scams that can happen to them.</p>



<p>To help the new crypto investors, we have created a <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/security-measures-every-crypto-investor-should-take/" data-wpel-link="internal">security checklist</a> they should follow. Keep reading to learn more about them.</p>



<p><strong>#1 Keep a check on fake websites and apps</strong></p>



<p>One of the most common threats that new investors should be careful about is fake websites and apps portraying themselves as legit and authentic.</p>



<p>If you are downloading an application, check its level of traction, reviews, branding and marketing, and other points that prove the app&#8217;s authenticity.</p>



<p>Similarly, when you visit a website, make sure to check the above-mentioned key points. Don&#8217;t just blindly trust social media advertisements; it has become easier to trap people using fake website ads.</p>



<p><strong>#2 Always create unique passwords and emails</strong></p>



<p>After selecting an official app or a crypto exchange of your choice, make sure you set up a new email specifically meant for crypto trading and create a unique password that you don&#8217;t use on any other platforms.</p>



<p>This is a usual mistake that investors make. They keep the same password for all the platforms to save themselves from extra confusion. Doing this may make your account vulnerable to security breaches.</p>



<p><strong>#3 Always enable 2-Factor Authentication</strong></p>



<p>After setting up your new email account and unique password, the most important thing to do is setting-up two-level verification checks for your account.</p>



<p>Firstly, never share your password with anyone. Keep them private and keep them to yourselves.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/two-factor-authentication-on-wazirx/" data-wpel-link="internal">two-factor authentication</a> (2FA), usually, you set a password, along with a one-time password (OTP). Enabling this verification method, investors can be double-sure about their crypto assets. Even though their password gets leaked, the hackers cannot move funds easily as they might have thought.</p>



<p><strong>#4 Keep a check on phishing scams</strong></p>



<p>To trick the new crypto investors into sharing their login credentials and other personal information, the scammers often use different kinds of scams and <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/top-ways-you-can-avoid-phishing-scams/" data-wpel-link="internal">phishing attacks</a>. In a phishing scam, the hackers portray themselves as authoritative figures and then create an urgency to ploy the investors. Due to the urgency created, the newbie investors forget to check the sender&#8217;s credibility.</p>



<p>As you enter the crypto market, keep reading about various scams and try not to fall into any trap. But, be aware, don&#8217;t be fooled; invest wisely!</p>



<p><strong>#5 Whitelisting</strong></p>



<p>Whitelisting is a type of authentication method by which you can pre-approve your wallets and crypto addresses as authenticated accounts from which you are able to send funds; the rest of other outgoing trades are blocked.</p>



<p>After whitelisting, even if your account is compromised, the hackers won&#8217;t be able to transfer your funds to an unknown wallet that they control; the reason behind your funds not getting transferred is because their address is not whitelisted.</p>



<h2>Bottom line</h2>



<p>As a newly introduced digital asset, cryptocurrency can be vulnerable to various online attacks and phishing scams if the precautions are not taken seriously. Furthermore, the security of your account can be compromised by hackers as they are always on the lookout for new crypto investors&#8217; accounts to fall prey to such scams. Therefore, the most important steps you can take are: always use your common sense and due diligence and keep a check on the above-mentioned security checklist.</p>

<p>The idea behind &#8220;centralization&#8221; can be related to the distribution of power and authority in an organization or a network. A centralized system means the decision-making authority is concentrated at a particular point in the organization.</p>



<p>In this article, let&#8217;s learn more about this concept, its advantages and disadvantages, and its associated risks.</p>



<h2>What is a centralized network?</h2>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>The foundation of a <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-dexs-came-to-the-rescue-of-cexs-shortcomings/" data-wpel-link="internal">centralized</a> network is based on a single, central server/master node, which manages all significant data processing and maintains data and user information that other users may access. From there, client nodes can connect to the main server and send data requests rather than processing them themselves.</p>



<p>A significant portion of web services, such as YouTube, app stores for mobiles, and online banking accounts, are controlled by a single network owner, necessitating third-party authorization verification for all data transactions carried out within these networks.</p>



<p>The form of network that is the most prevalent on the internet is a centralized one. These networks rely on a single network owner to link all the other satellite users and devices, creating a single point of failure that bad actors might intentionally take advantage of.</p>



<h2>Advantages of centralized network</h2>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<ul><li><strong>Simple, rapid deployment:</strong></li></ul>



<p>In centralized networks, command chains are well defined, network delegation is relatively straightforward, and the need for cross-chatter between different levels of authority is also reduced. Furthermore, by creating or deleting connections between the client node and the main server, it is equally simple to add and delete client nodes from the network. The computational power of the network is not increased, though.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Reduced costs:</strong></li></ul>



<p>One of the most significant advantages of centralization is the reduced cost. This is because the centralized network or system always requires less support and cost. In addition, since the centralized networks are pre-planned, and until and unless you don&#8217;t want to expand the centralized network, the cost associated with it will never go out of budget.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Consistency:</strong></li></ul>



<p>Since the centralized network follows a top-down approach, it&#8217;s easy to have a standardized interaction between the central server and client nodes. This automatically leads to a more consistent and streamlined end-user experience.</p>



<h2>Disadvantages of centralized network</h2>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<ul><li><strong>Single point of failure:</strong></li></ul>



<p>If the primary server crashes, there&#8217;s a possibility that the entire centralized system will shut down as they have a sole point of failure. As a result, client nodes will not be able to share, receive, or process user requests independently. Additionally, doing server maintenance may need briefly turning off the primary server, as a result which will probably cause service outages and user discomfort or lower reliability.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Trust factor:</strong></li></ul>



<p>Centralized organizations are safe and trustworthy but not entirely safe or trustworthy. The trust is basically an agreement that is set for the end-user by the service provider.</p>



<p>However, agreements are easily breakable. That&#8217;s why big organizations suffer from trust issues from their end-users.</p>



<p>When a system&#8217;s security is compromised, it sometimes takes some time for consumers to stop using the service until the provider rebuilds confidence by providing solutions and compensation to affected individuals. This happens because of centralization, and all the data are stored in a centralized database.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Scalability issues:</strong></li></ul>



<p>Centralized systems are hard to scale after a certain point; the only way to do so is by adding more storage, bandwidth, or computing capacity to the central server. In addition, information bottlenecks may develop if network traffic spikes exceed what the network can manage, which would cause users who are further away from the central server to suffer higher delays.</p>



<h2>How is centralization risk an issue?</h2>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Centralization risks are vulnerabilities that both unethical project developers and outside attackers may use to their advantage. They may be used in various attacks, including rug pulls, endless minting exploits and more.</p>



<p>In the case of a token minting contract exploit, whoever controls the contract&#8217;s <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-are-crypto-wallet-private-keys/" data-wpel-link="internal">private key</a> can create as many new tokens as they want and send them anywhere they want. The project&#8217;s founder, who had the private key, or an outsider who got hold of the contract&#8217;s private key, potentially due to ineffective key management, could be the attacker.</p>



<p>A rug pull is another type of exploit that takes advantage of centralized contract ownership. Every rug pull is distinct. For instance, in certain rug pulls, the project founders merely sell all of the tokens they possess out of malice, which effectively depletes the liquidity of a decentralized market.</p>



<p>Other rug pulls can entail founders taking tokens from a contract, such as a presale lockup contract, where users invest funds like Ethereum before launching a new currency. Again, <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/can-decentralized-exchanges-dex-become-mainstream/" data-wpel-link="internal">decentralized exchanges</a> are ideal for rug pulls since they don&#8217;t charge a fee to list new tokens and don&#8217;t need a smart contract audit.</p>



<h2>Bottom line</h2>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>A centralized network has a central server that manages all the critical data processing and user information that other users can have access to. Although the centralized network is trusted and secure, they are vulnerable to unethical project creators and outside attackers who may use this to fund their advantage. So be alert and keep a regular check on your networks!</p>

You can read more about how these provisions will affect you and learn about the steps taken by WazirX <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/tds-on-crypto-simplified/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">here</a>.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>While this would answer a lot of your questions, here are a few frequently asked questions about the new TDS rules:</p>



<p><strong>Question 1: Who will deduct tax as TDS when crypto is bought or sold via WazirX?</strong></p>



<p>WazirX will do the needful!</p>



<p>The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has clarified that when someone is buying Crypto via an Exchange (even in the case of P2P transactions), Tax can be deducted under section 194S by the Exchange. Making it simple; technically, you as a buyer or seller will not have to do anything. WazirX will do the needful.</p>



<p><strong>Question 2: At what rate will tax on crypto be deducted?</strong></p>



<p>Here is a simple table to answer this question:</p>



<p>​​<img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/VMUJ_bFgVNiEPr1fgb9bK98Ob_dEw_lL9t54yUjPuSKjgFbcP__f_6TOtYtFipeFiMcu_baui3meVCO3ObOl0mPexp6K1vAk6SwtIZM09x6PrUh3Tc6LIg25IClMEsUaXcGdN5Y15540V1YCCA" width="736" height="158"></p>



<p><strong>Question 3: For whom 5% TDS will be applicable and why?</strong></p>



<p>As per Section 206AB of the Income-Tax Act, 1961, if you have not filed your Income Tax Return in the last 2 years and the amount of TDS is ₹50,000 or more in each of these two previous years, then the tax to be deducted as TDS for Crypto-related transactions will be at 5%.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Question 4: On WazirX, where can I see the tax deducted on my trades?</strong></p>



<p>On WazirX, you can check the tax deducted as TDS on the order details page. Additionally, your Trading Report will also show the TDS details after 48 hours.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Question 5: Can I check the TDS details on any Government portal?</strong></p>



<p>You can find the details of the tax deducted in your Form 26AS (a consolidated annual tax statement issued by the Tax Department that shows the details of tax deducted at source) when updated by the Department.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Question 6: Can I claim the crypto TDS like other TDS?</strong></p>



<p>Yes! You can claim the tax deducted as TDS on crypto trades when you file ITR for the relevant financial year.</p>



<p><strong>Question 7: Will tax be deducted even if I am making a loss?</strong></p>



<p>Yes! Whether you make a profit or loss, Tax as TDS will be deducted for every Crypto bought or sold where applicable.</p>



<p><strong>Question 8: Will I have to pay TDS if I am trading on Foreign exchanges, P2P sites, and DEXes?</strong></p>



<p>Yes! You should be aware that users who transact on international exchanges that do not deduct TDS are liable to pay the tax on their own. Failure to do so would make you non-compliant with the existing tax laws of the land.</p>

<p>In the crypto-verse, people use anonymity or pseudonymity to some extent for security and privacy concerns or to move toward self-sovereignty. Both pseudonymity and anonymity offer crucial protections in their unique ways.</p>



<p>In this blog, let&#8217;s explore these concepts and briefly understand them.</p>



<h2>What do Pseudonymity &amp; Anonymity mean?</h2>



<p><strong>Anonymity</strong></p>



<p>In general, <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/are-cryptocurrencies-truly-anonymous/" data-wpel-link="internal">anonymity</a> implies that no one is aware of your true identity, while they are undoubtedly aware of your online activity. It means that you can carry on with your movements while staying anonymous. Your actions and your true identity are kept separate by anonymity.</p>



<p>In terms of blockchain security, anonymity means that no activity or transactions made on the blockchain or exchanges can be connected to a specific user, whether they are using a pseudonym or not.</p>



<p><strong>Pseudonymity</strong></p>



<p>The term &#8220;pseudonymity&#8221; refers to using a different name on social media, such as a pen-name or nick-name. It is typically utilized to conceal your true identity while maintaining your identity under another name.</p>



<p>While pseudonymity does allow a real person, such as an artist or poet, to keep their identity for their work through a pen-name or nick-name, some individuals abuse it to gain financial advantage through a false name. In these situations, the victim might blame the offender&#8217;s wrongdoing on his fictitious name but not on his true identity.</p>



<p>In terms of blockchain security, pseudonymity means that while the identity of the person making transactions is unknown, all of the transactions they make can be linked to the same pseudonymous identity.</p>



<p>Put simply, anonymity is a much more potent form of privacy than pseudonymity; however, with that comes some far-reaching implications that we shall see.</p>



<h2>Why are they crucial to cryptocurrencies?</h2>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-are-bitcoin-futures/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a> and Ethereum, the largest cryptocurrencies, work on pseudonymous systems. This simply means that the user&#8217;s identity remains unknown, and the activity associated with their wallet takes the form of a big cryptographic address. These addresses play a crucial role in keeping track of the fund&#8217;s flow from the perspective of blockchain security.</p>



<p>There are some projects that offer complete anonymity through cryptography. These projects are also known as &#8220;privacy coins&#8221; they prevent the transactions from being linked to particular addresses and eventually make it harder for the funds to get tracked.</p>



<p>Pseudonymity and anonymity have emerged as the central pillars of cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Have you heard the name &#8220;Satoshi Nakamoto&#8221;? If you&#8217;re into crypto, you&#8217;ve definitely heard about this infamous founder (s) of Bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym whose identity is still anonymous.</p>



<h2>Are they a boon or a bane to the cryptocurrencies?</h2>



<p>Ultimately, those who favor retaining complete pseudonymity and anonymity and those who want greater KYC and AML checks do so to support and protect blockchain security to make crypto safe and secure. Both developers and authorities are attempting to discover viable methods to guarantee blockchain security without compromising the principles of pseudonymity and anonymity cherished by the community because this is a young and quickly evolving business.</p>



<p>We would see significantly fewer rug pulls and other crypto scams if people had complete transparency on who was behind a project. Unfortunately, one of the most prominent drawbacks of pseudonymity and anonymity is how it has empowered bad actors whose anonymity allows them to operate with impunity.</p>



<h2>Final thoughts</h2>



<p>The discussion about the importance of having pseudonymity and anonymity or implementing rules and regulations is very much common. While it can be a hot topic for discussion, it is an unavoidable conversation as the crypto industry will have a widespread presence. In any case, all sides will have to make compromises to assure a safe and secure cryptocurrency and ongoing blockchain security.</p>

<p>WazirX, India’s largest crypto exchange, and Zebpay have launched a Trader Sentiment Survey involving ~9,500 respondents. The respondents only involved traders who have actively traded from the starting of the year till 15th April 2022. The findings revealed that 83% of traders believed that the recent tax implementation deterred their trading frequency. In addition, around 24% of respondents are contemplating shifting their trading activities to international exchanges owing to the high taxation. Further, 29% of the respondents traded lesser than the pre-tax period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the survey, 27% of the respondents sold over 50% of their portfolio before 1st April, whereas 57% sold under 10%. In the current scenario, revenue from tax collections for the government will decline as 27% of customers (34% traders and 23% holders) said they will trade less than earlier owing to the current taxation policy. The survey was conducted among a pool of traders and holders. While the traders were classified as those who traded every day, more than five times a week, or at least more than twice a week and the holders were those who traded a few times a month or were invested for the long term.</p>



<p>Addressing the survey findings, <strong>Rajagopal Menon, Vice President,&nbsp; WazirX</strong>, said, “It is our mission to put India at the forefront of the crypto revolution by constantly innovating and building the most secure, reliable, easy to use platform and assist the industry in developing a regulated ecosystem. However, it is important that the regulations support the inclusive growth of all stakeholders involved. The survey results stipulate the need to reform certain conditions to aid the growth of crypto investors in the country which will result in economic prosperity.&nbsp; The tax regime needs to be balanced to encourage participation and revive trading volumes.”</p>



<p>The report further indicates that the worst impacted were millennials compared to their senior counterparts. 28% of the respondents aged 18 and 35 have sold more than 50% of their holdings before 1st April. 23% wished to move their holdings to an international exchange to avail a more favorable tax climate. This emigration poses a significant risk in terms of investors falling prey to non-KYC compliant international exchanges. This is in addition to the fact that 40% of the total affected traders have already sold more than 50% of their holdings before 1st April.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response to the survey findings, <strong>Avinash Shekhar, CEO of ZebPay, said</strong>, “The results indicate a considerable number of respondents intend to reduce their trade frequency and participation in the category. Crypto is driving revolutionary change across the world and it is in our nation’s interests to encourage, not dissuade, participation. Restrictive policies serve as a barrier to both adoption and innovation. While India’s crypto tax policy is a step forward, reconsidering certain aspects will help build a more supportive regulatory environment for all industry stakeholders and will ultimately contribute to overall economic progress.”</p>



<p>The holders had continued to retain their positions, with 45% saying they would hold on to their positions. This signifies their faith that the tax provisions will be made more conducive in the longer term.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The systematic set-up of Decentralized Apps (DApps) regretfully makes them vulnerable to hackers who can break into the system anytime. As we know, DApps use open-source smart contracts, so it becomes easy for hackers to find a weakness in the network that lets them break into the blockchain. A smart contract audit is an excellent approach to fixing problems before it&#8217;s too late.</p>



<p>Before deep-diving into the security aspects of DApps, let&#8217;s understand the basics of Decentralized Applications and some of their pros and cons.</p>



<h2>What are DApps?</h2>



<p>A Decentralized Application (DApp) is an application that is created on a decentralized network and joins a smart contract and a frontend UI. A software program is stored on a centralized network. Based on the frontend requests, it processes, computes, and manipulates data that it gets from numerous sources.</p>



<p>A Decentralized Application (DApp) runs its backend code on a decentralized technology like blockchain, where it receives and processes data from the blockchain, such as smart contracts. DApps don&#8217;t have data silos or a single point of failure because a single server or organization doesn&#8217;t manage them. Due to DApps&#8217; decentralized structure, others are free to build on top of a developer&#8217;s public source. The app is not under the administration of a single entity. Applications for <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-problems-can-defi-solve/" data-wpel-link="internal">Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</a>, web surfing, gaming, and social media are just a few of the many types of DApps that might have been built.</p>



<p>What makes DApp so unique? Have you ever wondered? Let&#8217;s find out in the next section that is about their characteristic features.</p>



<h2>Characteristics of DApps</h2>



<ul><li>Open source: The majority of users decide on all necessary changes in unison. To do this, the codebase must be accessible to all users for review.</li><li>Decentralized storage: They offer decentralized storage. On distributed blocks, data is kept.</li><li>Provides benefits of cryptography: They provide cryptographic algorithms. Decentralized data blocks are verified and proven to be true.</li></ul>



<h2>Pros of DApps</h2>



<ul><li>Data integrity: Because blockchain consensus algorithms guarantee that the data recorded in a blockchain is resistant to modification, data kept on a blockchain is immutable and safe.</li><li>Adaptable platform: The flexibility of the Ethereum blockchain allows for the rapid creation of DApps for many sectors.</li><li>User privacy: Users can use any app-specific features without providing any personal information to DApps.</li></ul>



<h2>Cons of DApps</h2>



<ul><li>Maintenance: <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-dapps/" data-wpel-link="internal">DApps</a> are challenging to manage, troubleshoot, and update since every fix necessitates the agreement of every peer in the blockchain-based network.</li><li>Difficult to scale: Scaling decentralized networks is more challenging than scaling centralized networks.</li><li>Network congestion: If a DApp uses excessive amounts of resources, it will back up the entire network.</li></ul>



<h2>How stay safe and secure?</h2>



<p>In any blockchain project, security can be a significant issue. The first thing you can do for the DApp security is a smart contract audit; this will identify the vulnerabilities. A smart contract audit helps you discover security flaws in your smart contract and blockchain code and provide propositions on how to solve them.</p>



<p>Another significant step toward DApps security is penetration testing. It offers a secure and thorough attack simulation to reveal the most intricate flaws in crypto exchanges, wallets, and DApps. Some advantages of penetration testing are finding hidden vulnerabilities, assessing node vulnerabilities, testing APIs, and finding new attack paths.</p>



<p>When combined with a smart contract audit, penetration testing gives the best result.</p>



<h2>Protective measures to be kept in mind</h2>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/top-ways-you-can-avoid-phishing-scams/" data-wpel-link="internal">Phishing scams</a> are a frequent DApps fraud. The social engineering strategy known as phishing is frequently used to obtain user data, such as login passwords and wallet information. To mislead a victim into providing personal information or, for example, linking their wallet to a false browser extension, the users often hand over their private data, generally through a phishing website.</p>



<ul><li>Keep your recovery phrase private: Never disclose your 12-word recovery phrase. The recovery phrase will only provide you access to your wallet.</li><li>Research DApp websites: Verify the legitimacy of the DApp website you intend to use. Additionally, make sure you&#8217;re using the right DApp website URL.</li><li>Keep your pace slow: Watch out for typos, misspellings, and grammar errors. Grammar and spelling errors are common among scammers.</li></ul>



<h2>Bottom line</h2>



<p>Keeping safety and security in mind is crucial as more firms move to DApps and other cloud-based architectures. Unfortunately, cybercriminals will continue to hunt for methods to hack technology. Stay safe!</p>

<p>&#8220;Crypto winter is coming!&#8221;, &#8220;Crypto is dead!&#8221;, &#8220;How long will the Crypto bear market last?&#8221; If you have been a part of the Crypto industry, you must have heard these headlines that have been hitting the mainstream media. Things for the Crypto industry are not looking good, but does that mean you&#8217;ll lose all faith in the industry? You shouldn&#8217;t! We have curated a few ways for you that can help you survive the Crypto bear market in 2022.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s start our journey!</p>



<p>Wait!!! Before we start, let&#8217;s first understand the basic terms like the Crypto bear market and Crypto winter.</p>



<h2>What is a Crypto bear market?</h2>



<p>A bear market refers to the negative or a downward trend in the prices of a market. It is not necessarily that it is used only in the Cryptocurrency space but also in the traditional markets like stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.</p>



<p>In general terms, a bear market is a solid market downtrend that shows a significant decline in the prices for a relatively short period. However, when we compare this downtrend between the Crypto-verse and the traditional markets, the Crypto industry is more petite and highly <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/will-crypto-markets-get-less-volatile/" data-wpel-link="internal">volatile</a>. Therefore, it is considered usual to see stronger and prolonged bear markets, where 85% drops are pretty standard.</p>



<h2>What is Crypto winter?</h2>



<p>Before we jump on to what Crypto winter is, have you heard of the famous HBO series &#8220;Game of Thrones&#8221;? You must have likely heard about it, and its famous phrase, &#8220;Winter is Coming.&#8221; The term &#8220;Winter is Coming&#8221; was considered a warning about a conflict that could last for a more extended period and could happen at any time in the land of Westeros.</p>



<p>Coming to the Crypto industry, the Crypto winter is about to arrive, and this is going to be a challenging time for the investors and companies, whoever is related to this industry. During this period, you must be prepared for the chaos that can come without much warning.</p>



<p>In literal terms, the phrase &#8220;Crypto winter&#8221; is when the prices go down and remain like that for an extended period. According to market analysts, the Crypto winter has started to show its arrival earlier in 2022.</p>



<p>Okay, so now, in the following section, we&#8217;ll see the survival ways for an investor in the Crypto bear market.</p>



<h2>5 Ways to Survive the Crypto bear market</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Take a break</strong></li></ul>



<p>The first and foremost thing to do is &#8220;take a break&#8221;! During the downtrend of the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/why-are-the-crypto-markets-crashing-in-2022/" data-wpel-link="internal">Crypto market</a>, it is obvious to be negative, but it is also apparent to maintain a healthy state of being. It gets self-evident to have tunnel vision during such times; if you think you are facing this, you do yourself a favor and take a step back.</p>



<p>Try to divert your mind off the market for some time, go on a vacation or meet a friend whom you&#8217;ve not met for quite a long time, or indulge in some artwork.</p>



<p>If you have faith in the potential of blockchain and Cryptocurrency, keep in mind that the basics have never been more optimistic in the recent history of this industry.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Don&#8217;t try to time the bottom</strong>.</li></ul>



<p>Don&#8217;t blindly trust the experts or influencers who tell you that they can accurately call the bottom; they are merely relying on astrology or trying to be the Nostradamus of Crypto.</p>



<p>In simple terms, timing the bottom means you want to purchase Crypto at its lowest possible price. However, if you think you bought Crypto at its lowest at any given time, remember that its price could still drop. This implies that you&#8217;ll be forced to sell that Crypto again to purchase at a lower price. If you do this, you will be more likely to shrink your portfolio.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Use Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)</strong></li></ul>



<p>Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) is a type of investment method in which the Crypto investors split a given amount they intend to invest and then invest money in a particular asset (e.g., a stock or a Cryptocurrency) at regular time intervals, whether the Crypto market is up or down. This is among the most excellent tactics to use during the Crypto bear market.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Consider staking</strong></li></ul>



<p>Investors may experience insecurity during a bear market in Cryptocurrencies due to the declining value of their holdings, and they may frequently seek for strategies to protect their investments. In the Cryptocurrency world, &#8220;staking&#8221; is one method to enhance your security and profit over the course of a long-term hold.</p>



<p>Staking involves locking up your Cryptocurrency coins on a blockchain for a set period to generate passive income.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Always DYOR!</strong></li></ul>



<p>While it&#8217;s essential to pay attention to a company&#8217;s reps and be open to their perspectives, nothing improves your judgment like independent research. So before opting to trade BTC/USD versus ETH/USD or any other Cryptocurrency, always look at their historical charts.</p>



<h2>Final thoughts: Have a life outside the Crypto world!</h2>



<p>Crypto is a 24/7 market. It will feel like a Netflix show you can binge-watch, and it&#8217;s so easy to get overwhelmed and lose sight of other things. So, instead, focus on going out to meet your friends, go shopping, or indulge in some hobbies.</p>

<p>When we talk about &#8220;mintable tokens,&#8221; it is possible that you&#8217;ve heard about &#8220;mineable tokens&#8221; as well. There&#8217;s no wonder if you get confused between these two terms; they are a complicated affair, primarily because they sound very similar. While they are crucial for the cryptocurrency world today, there are some critical differences between them in terms of utility and design. The type of functions they can perform and the security risks they possess have far-reaching implications.</p>



<p>Keep reading to find out more about this!</p>



<h2>General discussion on mintable &amp; minable token</h2>



<p>Do you know that both mintable and minable tokens produce new tokens? The only difference between them is that minting new tokens through mining involves a lot of time, effort, and resources.</p>



<p>As you likely know, to uphold the validity of the network, both the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-whats-better/" data-wpel-link="internal">proof-of-work and proof-of-stake</a> protocols use the mechanisms that users have a vested interest in. In the case of proof-of-work tokens, this investment takes the form of considerable computing energy to find the quickest solution to challenging equations to submit new transactions and win the block reward.</p>



<p>In proof of stake, the investment is made by users who already have a stake in the network. As a result, they are eligible to participate in a random lottery in which the winner is chosen to validate the following block and, you guessed it, receive the block reward.</p>



<p>The block reward is given a fixed number in each, so it is impossible to manipulate the token supply. Consequently, both the processes provide surety that the cryptocurrency has a limited supply, and the scarcity of the currency is also ensured.</p>



<p>Conversely, the mintable tokens are not dependent on any underlying consensus method for their supply. Instead, they are minted with the help of smart contracts enabled by platforms like Ethereum. As a result, they may be safeguarded by having a smart contract audit performed by a third party, a rigorous peer-review process that better defends the reviewed project against attack.</p>



<p>What do you think of the supply of these mintable tokens? Are they fixed, or are they unlimited? Let&#8217;s find out in the section below.</p>



<h2>Types of categories of supply of mintable tokens</h2>



<p>The supply of mintable tokens falls under two categories that are described below:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Fixed Supply:</strong></li></ol>



<p>The fixed supply model is implemented to generate scarcity and raise the underlying asset&#8217;s value. Fixed supply is mainly referred to as deflationary because once the supply is reached, no additional tokens are minted, and the price of the token rises as demand increases.</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Continuous Supply:</strong></li></ol>



<p>The continuous supply model is considered inflationary, meaning new tokens are often minted regularly for a purpose like utilities. In a continuous supply model, improving the underlying utility and benefits—rather than raising the price—is the primary goal. Stablecoins that uphold a 1:1 peg with the US dollar similarly employ the continuous supply model, and the protocol ensures that each token&#8217;s price never rises above or falls below $1.</p>



<h2>Prime examples of mintable tokens</h2>



<p>Although there are various examples of mintable tokens, for now, we&#8217;ll focus on two of the prime examples &#8211; Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and Stablecoins. These two can be minted on any<a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-are-smart-contracts-and-why-you-need-to-know-about-them/" data-wpel-link="internal"> smart contract</a> platform, but we will focus on Ethereum, as it is one of the most popular choices. So let&#8217;s check them out!</p>



<p><strong>Example 1 &#8211; Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)</strong></p>



<p>If you&#8217;re a Web3 enthusiast, you must have heard of NFTS. They are one in a million and can&#8217;t be duplicated. You can sell any of your art forms, whether music, painting, or a tweet, anything digital on NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea.</p>



<p>On Ethereum, most of the NFTs are minted using the ERC-721 token standard. Therefore, to create or transfer your NFT to a different address, before selling the NFT, it is necessary to mint it on the Ethereum platform as an ERC-721 token.</p>



<p>As you&#8217;ve observed, there has been a spike in the creation of several NFT projects over the last year. Similar to cryptocurrencies, the NFT projects can also be made secure with the smart contract audit.</p>



<p><strong>Example 2 &#8211; Stablecoins</strong></p>



<p>One of the prime examples of minted tokens is the stablecoins; they uphold a 1:1 peg with the US Dollar. Therefore, the price of each stablecoin is worth $1, and the protocol adjusts the price to maintain the $1 peg. In the above section, we learned about how the continuous supply model is best suited for the supply of stablecoins.</p>



<p>The model is simple. When a stablecoin&#8217;s price exceeds $1, the supply is reduced to return the price to $1. Then, a stablecoin&#8217;s supply is raised to raise the price and keep the peg in place if it drops below $1.</p>



<h2>Bottom line</h2>



<p>By minting new tokens, developers and businesses can easily fund their projects and provide an economic framework for their software to appeal to people. However, the investors should do their research before making any investments because not all tokens are worthwhile investments.</p>

<p>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a complicated and quickly evolving sector that builds on the conceptual and ideological grounds of a more effective, censorship-resistant, and open, decentralized financial system.</p>



<p>These characteristics are best shown by algorithmic stablecoins, which combine elements of monetary economics, financial markets, mathematics, and technology. These innovative and complex technologies, which sit at the nexus of blockchain and money, provide several challenges and unsolved issues regarding how the future of <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/is-this-the-endgame-of-decentralization-in-defi/" data-wpel-link="internal">DeFi</a> will evolve.</p>



<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll explore what algorithmic stablecoins are, their key features, their types, and their pros &amp; cons.</p>



<h2>Introduction to algorithmic stablecoins</h2>



<p>An algorithmic stablecoin is linked to a reserve asset, such as the U.S. dollar, gold, or any other foreign currency, to ensure price stability and balance the circulating supply of an asset.</p>



<p>In other words, an algorithmic stablecoin truly uses an underlying algorithm that can create more coins when their value rises and purchase them off the market when their value declines.</p>



<p>As the supply, demand, and target price are all controlled by the code, an algorithmic stablecoin is an example of what real decentralization looks like, as there are no regulatory agencies to maintain or monitor the processes.</p>



<p>Algorithmic stablecoins fill a requirement in the crypto ecosystem by reintroducing the seigniorage back into the coin economy where individuals can share it.</p>



<p>One such algorithmic stablecoin is USDD which was recently launched on the TRON blockchain. To read more about it, click <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/introduction-to-usdd-an-algorithmic-stablecoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">here</a>.</p>



<h2>Key features of the algorithmic stablecoins</h2>



<p>An algorithmic stablecoin aims to make trading more approachable for experienced and novice users. Following are some features of algorithmic stablecoins:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Limited Volatility = Value Addition</strong></li></ol>



<p>Due to their limited price volatility and usefulness level, stablecoins serve as reliable repositories of value. Stablecoins may therefore be readily included in cross-border transactions. Additionally, the collateral diversification demonstrated by these stablecoins creates resistance against hyperinflation and unstable markets.</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Adaptive Responses to the Market</strong></li></ol>



<p>The algorithm&#8217;s parameters, which are hardcoded into smart contracts, guarantee an automated response to market data without requiring direct human participation. Following an analysis of the underlying market circumstances, these factors attempt to stabilize market supply and demand for these tokens.</p>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Security</strong></li></ol>



<p>By utilizing a private key, stablecoins may be securely kept in online wallets. The linked funds can only be accessed by the stablecoin holder. For higher security levels, one can use advanced encryption technologies.</p>



<h2>Types of algorithmic stablecoins &amp; their working</h2>



<p>There are two types of algorithmic stablecoins:</p>



<ul><li>Rebase</li></ul>



<ul><li>Seigniorage.</li></ul>



<p>Rebase stablecoins alter the stablecoin&#8217;s supply to keep a stablecoin&#8217;s peg with fiat currencies. To maintain the stable value, the protocol mints (adds) or burns (removes) coins in accordance with the stablecoin&#8217;s price fluctuation. Coins are taken out of circulation if the price of the stablecoins falls below $1, and vice versa.</p>



<p>Seigniorage stablecoins function similarly. To have more control over its value, they also combine stablecoin with other cryptocurrencies. The system provides incentives to market players to buy/sell the paired cryptocurrencies in addition to a mint and burn mechanism to preserve the stablecoin&#8217;s price.</p>



<p>A great example of a seigniorage stablecoin is TerraUSD. It keeps its valuation in relation to the USD using <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/luna-2-0-the-revival-plan-for-terra/" data-wpel-link="internal">LUNA</a>, the native cryptocurrency of Terra. However, this creative pegging strategy also contributed to its failure.</p>



<h2>Pros and cons of algorithmic stablecoins</h2>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<p>The regulations regarding the underlying financial system are defined by the code for algorithmic stablecoins, meaning no regulatory bodies are watching over user transactions. This makes algorithmic stablecoins the ultimate embodiment of decentralization. Additionally, algorithmic stablecoin minimizes the possibility of user error by not requiring a physical asset.</p>



<p>Seigniorage, or the ability to evaluate the profit or loss earned on the production of a currency, was once again brought to the crypto ecosystem by algorithmic stablecoins.</p>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<p>First, for the apparently stable cryptocurrencies to function correctly, there must be a certain level of demand. If demand falls below a certain point, the system breaks down.</p>



<p>Second, stablecoins are weak because they depend on self-driven, independent investors who must be eager to benefit from the mechanism that maintains TerraUSD linked to the dollar.</p>



<p>Finally, this kind of stablecoin may devalue during crises due to traders responding to confusing information and uncertainty. Additionally, it may encourage the selling of the underlying stablecoin, which would lead to a sharp price decline.</p>



<h2>Curtain thoughts on the future of algorithmic stablecoins</h2>



<p>Until now, speculative arbitrage trading and liquidity pools have made considerable use of algorithmic stablecoins. However, the recent Terra fall makes the future seems gloomy. The legislators closely monitor market trends and may impose strict rules on these stablecoins.</p>

<p>The Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental organization that develops anti-money laundering (AML) policy for the G-7 and about 30 other wealthy countries, issued the <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/pdfs/FATF%20Recommendations%202012.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">FATF Recommendation #16</a>, also known as the Travel Rule to deal with the crypto market&#8217;s heightened money-laundering concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Travel Rule mandates that organizations collect and exchange personal data from transaction parties. The Rule initially only applied to banks. The FATF, however, expanded this regulation to crypto firms in 2019. In addition, the G20 and several other jurisdictions began incorporating the Travel Rule into their local anti-money laundering laws in 2020.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s look at the impact of the Travel Rule in more detail.</p>



<h2>Travel Rule 101</h2>



<p>Crypto exchanges, custodial wallet providers, and other virtual asset service providers (VASPs) must disclose personal client data accurately during transactions under this regulation. Information such as the sender&#8217;s and recipient&#8217;s names, geographic addresses, account numbers, and more must be collected and submitted to the appropriate authorities. Specifically, whenever the amount transacted exceeds $1,000, the regulations oblige VASPs to share information about the originator and beneficiary&#8217;s identities.</p>



<p>Simply put, if two parties exchange crypto valued at more than $1,000, the sender&#8217;s crypto service provider is expected to communicate the sender&#8217;s personally identifiable information to the recipient&#8217;s crypto service provider and vice versa.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Albeit, member states can interpret and implement variations of the guidance that best suit their crypto sectors.</p>



<h2>Significance of Travel Rule for Crypto Transactions</h2>



<p>The reasons why the travel rule is significant are as follows:</p>



<ul><li>The primary goal of this Rule is to prevent terrorist financing and money laundering.</li><li>Increases transparency in the cryptocurrency sector.</li><li>The law enforcement agencies can obtain transaction data by issuing subpoenas.</li><li>The travel rule assures that crypto firms follow sanctioned practices.</li><li>It is the first worldwide crypto law, and it has the ability to pave the way for more standard crypto regulation.</li><li>The most significant effect of this Rule will be to integrate the crypto market into the existing financial industry, allowing for a more organized and mature class of assets to emerge.</li></ul>



<h2>The Drawbacks</h2>



<ul><li>Concerns regarding information confidentiality are the most visible backlash here. Privacy-based laws and the FATF Travel Rule may have a counter-productive impact and create perplexity, further downsizing the market.&nbsp;</li><li>Anonymous coins may not be able to meet the FATF&#8217;s data requirements.</li><li>The regional nonuniformity in enforcing this legislation is also a trouble. The travel rule&#8217;s restrictions change from country to country. The &#8220;<a href="https://notabene.id/sunrise-issue" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Sunrise Problem</a>&#8221; refers to the nonuniformity of crypto travel rules. It has been re-iterated by various experts that solving the Sunrise Problem is one of the significant paths leading to crypto mass adoption.</li><li>Another central talking point is the additional cost of compliance bore by the crypto corporations. This will discourage the new market entrants and further reduce the market size as well as the bargaining power of the customers.</li></ul>



<h2>What does it mean for us?</h2>



<p>Yes, you have the right thought in your mind. You may have to forego some amount of your privacy while you divulge into the crypto market. Users should also be aware of the beneficiaries while interacting in the crypto market. Since crypto is still a young asset class, regulations like these pose the risk of uncertainty as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But we need to remember that the travel rule is still a work in progress. Therefore, it&#8217;s impossible to say how inefficiencies in any compliance processes may affect your user experience.</p>



<h2>Bottom Line</h2>



<p>The FATF Travel Rule aims to prevent money laundering while ensuring the anonymity of wire and crypto transactions. Corporations and Legal bodies can detect suspicious users and avoid fraud by following this guideline, which entails collecting and exchanging sender and recipient data.</p>

<p>Many people falsely believe that cryptocurrencies and fiat money are the same things; it&#8217;s just that crypto exists in digital form. However, if conventional advancement laws bounded the blockchain industry, it wouldn&#8217;t be as wild as it is right now, would it?</p>



<p>The artistic aspect of the cryptocurrency trading sector has seen significant recent growth. These innovations have rocked the fintech industry and astonished GenZ and millennials with booming investment options. As a result, NFTs have started showing their massive presence in the fintech space.</p>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/the-pros-and-cons-of-nft-art/" data-wpel-link="internal">Non-Fungible Tokens</a> (NFTs) are exclusive tokens that can only be owned by one entity. Unfortunately, due to their scarcity and smart supply-demand imbalance, they are typically overvalued, which further increases their worth.</p>



<p>In this blog, let&#8217;s understand why NFTs gain their value and how they get overvalued.</p>



<h2>NFT: The concept</h2>



<p>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) use the same programming that is used for cryptocurrencies for their creation. These cryptographic assets are built on blockchain technology, to put it simply. Like other digital assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, they cannot be traded or swapped on an equal basis.</p>



<p>The term NFT denotes that it cannot be altered or substituted due to its distinctive qualities. Fiat money and cryptocurrencies may be traded or swapped for one another since they are both fungible.</p>



<p><strong>Key Features of NFT</strong></p>



<ul><li>Digital Asset &#8211; NFT is a cryptocurrency that uses blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrencies to represent digital assets like music, games, and artwork with an official certificate.</li><li>Unique &#8211; It is unique and cannot be copied or altered.</li><li>Exchange &#8211; On specialized websites, NFT exchanges involving cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin) take place.</li></ul>



<p>Let&#8217;s jump on to the crucial reasons that provide value to the NFTs and are also responsible for their overvaluation. Keep reading!</p>



<h2>4 Founding Pillars of NFT</h2>



<ol><li><strong>Liquidity</strong></li></ol>



<p>In simplest terms, liquidity is a metric of how simple it is for a trader to enter and exit positions.</p>



<p>Liquidity pools allow trading crypto assets on various decentralized exchanges and <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/is-this-the-endgame-of-decentralization-in-defi/" data-wpel-link="internal">DeFi platforms</a>.</p>



<p>High liquidity and the presence of an organized liquidity pool are highly valued in the field of NFT trading. Furthermore, higher liquidity minimizes the danger of the project becoming a possible rug pull by demonstrating the reliability of the NFTs.</p>



<p>Simple logic explains the significance of liquidity for NFTs: if no one wants to buy your owned NFT, you cannot sell it. Therefore, to trade your NFT on both primary and secondary markets in return for the same amount of ETH, your NFT must have a liquidity premium supported by the ERC standards.</p>



<p>Investors frequently choose to invest in NFT projects with significant trading volumes to reduce risks since this ensures that the projects have strong liquidity and can be exchanged whenever you want.</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Ownership History</strong></li></ol>



<p>The initial price of an NFT is not constrained; it is determined by creator affordability and business strategy. Because of this, despite the average floor pricing (average low price) on an NFT trading exchange, certain NFTs are found to be absurdly expensive compared to others.</p>



<p>However, for NFT traders, the ownership history is crucial. High ownership history values are more common among reputable artists and NFT makers, which helps to identify their work as exclusive and preserve its market worth. Even though many individuals may find it difficult to afford them, NFTs with a distinguished ownership history draw a broad spectrum of buyers who are sure they will be able to get a valuable item that is highly valued in the NFT community.</p>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Rarity</strong></li></ol>



<p>The foundation of NFTs is the idea that tokens should be uncommon and distinctive. Because of this, the market is always volatile, and NFT prices rise because someone else frequently wants to acquire a rare work of art at a greater price than you.</p>



<p>Because of this, rarity is unquestionably the fundamental attribute that underpins an NFT and determines its existence.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, depending on the value proposition offered to the clients, certain NFTs are valued higher than others. For example, well-known projects like World of Women or CryptoPunks, also Known as 10K projects (10,000 piece projects), are made up of 10,000 uniquely designed NFTs with various characteristics.</p>



<p>Since certain items may have exquisite and distinctive qualities that provide more value, their designers may charge a greater price for them to give their clients an exceptional experience when buying a high-end NFT. In cryptocurrency, these rarities are quite significant since they may distinguish the flashiness or third eyes on a profile-picture NFT from a group of thousands of other identical objects.</p>



<ol start="4"><li><strong>Utility</strong></li></ol>



<p>Any cryptocurrency, token, or NFT project cannot survive in the current market without adequate utility. Since this enables them to assess the worth of their assets and plan future investments, large-scale investors frequently invest in initiatives with strong utility in their roadmaps.</p>



<h2>Final thoughts</h2>



<p>The full potential of NFTs has hardly even been scratched.

<p>Hedge funds are possibly shorting Tether, the biggest stablecoin in the world. This occurs when the market continues to experience a sharp sell-off following the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/luna-2-0-the-revival-plan-for-terra/" data-wpel-link="internal">Terra-Luna fiasco</a>.</p>



<p>According to a Wall Street Journal report, major cryptocurrency brokerage platforms have been used by more conventional hedge funds to execute bets to short Tether. These trades have a &#8220;hundreds of millions&#8221; dollar value. It will be exciting to observe how things develop. Let&#8217;s take a look at the current situation till then.</p>



<p>Before we move forward, a few terms and definitions may need quick introductions throughout the blog. So we&#8217;ll be looking at them at short intervals.</p>



<h2>What is shorting?</h2>



<p>Shorting or short-selling means selling a cryptocurrency to later buy it back at a lower price. Traders can then benefit from the price difference in the market. The familiar adage &#8220;buy low, sell high&#8221; is flipped on its head by short-selling; instead of buying low, selling high, the trader sells the asset first, then repurchases them later.</p>



<h2>What are Crypto hedge funds?</h2>



<p>Unlike a cryptocurrency index fund, an ETF, or an exchange, a hedge fund is a discrete way for a person to invest in a significant set of underlying securities. These are monitored by a group of knowledgable investors, periodically rebalanced, and subjected to extensive analysis. Profits from these specialists&#8217; market moves go to investors.</p>



<p>In other words, hedge funds are financial holding firms where investors deposit their money in exchange for the promise of active returns from either shorting or holding long positions.</p>



<h2>What happens when hedge funds short cryptocurrencies?</h2>



<p>It starts like this: Hedge funds that short stocks, commodities, or cryptocurrencies have a strong interest in seeing the value of their target decline, and they frequently aid this via a variety of strategies, making the public aware of what they believe to be a weakness in particular.</p>



<p>There are two issues here. First, unlike with a typical cryptocurrency, you are not expecting the price of a stablecoin would decrease when you short it. Instead, you are placing a bet on it that it will break the buck or lose its dollar peg. This might result in a confidence-based collapse that would be quicker and more difficult to halt than any bank, as several authorities worldwide have long warned.</p>



<p>This is what happened to TerraUSD, which had been the third most valuable stablecoin and took just a week to practically lose all of its value. It also impacted Tether, with USDT surpassing the $1 mark and momentarily falling to $0.95.</p>



<p>Now, let&#8217;s see what&#8217;s happening with Tether and why its CTO took it to Twitter and refuted all the claims by hedge funds.</p>



<h2>Shorting Tether: What&#8217;s exactly happening?</h2>



<p>Hedge funds are shorting Tether as a result of the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates by 0.75% to restrict the supply of dollars and thereby limit inflation. According to the report, hedge funds think since Tether is pegged to the US dollar, it should also affect the Tether stablecoin. Other hedge funds are worried about whether any assets are supporting Tether in the meanwhile.</p>



<p>However, Tether&#8217;s CTO, Paolo Ardoino, responded to all of the hedge funds&#8217; accusations on Twitter. Ardoino mentioned all the strategies adopted by traditional finance to short Tether. He also added that to destroy Tether&#8217;s reputation and cause a black swan event, &#8220;competitors were spreading via coordinated troll networks.&#8221;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>It is important to note that Tether might de-peg from its value and lead to another stablecoin meltdown if hedge funds decide to short it. However, unlike Terra-Luna, it is not an algo stablecoin which means real assets back it.</p>



<p>Algorithmic stablecoins, in their most basic form, are fully uncollateralized. Therefore, they have no outside asset to support their worth. To read more about them, click <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/introduction-to-usdd-an-algorithmic-stablecoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">here</a>.</p>



<h2>What does Tether have to say here?</h2>



<p>A few hours later, Paolo Ardoino, the CTO of Tether, used Twitter to disprove the methodology and justification used by hedge funds to short USDT. In a Twitter thread, he described the methods that traditional finance used to short the world&#8217;s largest stablecoin by market cap.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/<br>I have been open about the attempts from some hedge funds that were trying to cause further panic on the market after TERRA/LUNA collapse.<br>It really seemed from the beginning a coordinated attack, with a new wave of FUD, troll armies, clowns etc. <a href="https://t.co/hhcsgHV1Ow" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/hhcsgHV1Ow</a></p>&mdash; Paolo Ardoino (@paoloardoino) <a href="https://twitter.com/paoloardoino/status/1541418818664292355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">June 27, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Tether showed a record for liquidity after a bank ran on its holdings following Terra&#8217;s collapse. A mere 5% run on a U.K. bank&#8217;s assets in 2007 led to a government bailout and the bank&#8217;s eventual transfer to state control.</p>



<p>Given that $16 billion, or almost 20% of its market worth, has been taken out of Tether over the previous month with no public reports of redemptions, it is clear that Tether has sustained more significant pressure over a shorter length of time without experiencing any apparent problems.</p>



<p>The Wall Street Journal cited a $16 billion drop in Tether&#8217;s market worth, which is now at $67 billion, but did not mention how that would have affected its reserves.</p>



<h2>Is there some regulatory pressure over Tether?</h2>



<p>Tether has previously been under regulatory investigation in the past and has been heavily questioned about the assets and reserves that support the coin&#8217;s value. The New York attorney general&#8217;s office accused Tether of making several public misrepresentations about the dollar reserves supporting it, and the two parties came to an $18.5 million settlement in 2021. However, <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/whats-happening-with-tether/" data-wpel-link="internal">Tether</a> didn&#8217;t acknowledge or reject any of the charges at the time. It has been in constant denial of all the rumors related to its portfolio of commercial papers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As redemptions increase, the market capitalization of Tether has fallen below $70 billion at this moment. However, according to CoinMarketCap, Tether&#8217;s price is $1, which is still linked to the USD.</p>

<p>The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) lets users select distinctive domain names for their wallet addresses. Using a computer to comprehend this domain is the key to this technique.</p>



<p>Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has the potential to be the deciding factor in <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-web3-for-beginners/" data-wpel-link="internal">Web3</a> communication. We&#8217;ll provide an overview of the Ethereum Name Service in this blog.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s start with the basic introduction.</p>



<h2>What is Ethereum Name Service (ENS)?</h2>



<p>Crypto addresses are long sequences of numbers and characters designed for computer reading. Unfortunately, these lengthy addresses have resulted in confusion and even financial losses.</p>



<p>The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a distributed system built on the Ethereum blockchain that offers an easy alternative to lengthy and complicated crypto addresses: one URL similar to a website name or email that serves as a crypto address.</p>



<p>ENS maps the lengthy public address that crypto users know, and it can be replaced with a short and straightforward name that is simple to read and remember. Something complicated like, “0xDC25EF3F5B8A186998338A2ADA83795FBA2D695E” becomes as easy as “Alice.eth.”</p>



<p>ENS utilizes the same principle as the Domain Name Service (DNS), which maps short website URLs to their IP addresses to make crypto addresses simpler to read and share.</p>



<h2>Quick facts about ENS</h2>



<ul><li>ENS comprises two Ethereum smart contracts: the ENS registry, which stores domain names, and the resolver, which transforms domain names to machine-readable addresses and vice-versa.</li><li>Just as in the early days of DNS names, users scramble to secure their ENS domains before they run out of unavailability.</li><li>ENS supports a variety of top-level domains, like .com, .org, .io, .app and more.</li><li>ENS is presently supported by browsers like Brave, Opera, Status (mobile), MetaMask Mobile (mobile), and Puma. Internet browsers like Chrome and Safari don&#8217;t support ENS.</li></ul>



<p>With these quick facts, it&#8217;ll be easy to understand how the ENS works. Let&#8217;s check the below sections to learn more about it.</p>



<h2>How does ENS work?</h2>



<p>Two Ethereum <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-are-smart-contracts-and-why-you-need-to-know-about-them/" data-wpel-link="internal">smart contracts</a> form the basis of ENS. The ENS registry keeps a record of all domains registered on ENS. It saves three vital pieces of information about each domain, including the domain owner, the domain resolver, and the caching time for all records under the domain is the first smart contract. The second smart contract is the resolver, which converts domain names into machine-readable addresses and vice versa. With the help of the second smart contract, each domain is connected to the appropriate user, website, or location.</p>



<p>Users of the ENS app can begin by looking for a domain name that is currently accessible before creating their Web3 account. Once you&#8217;ve found one, all that&#8217;s left to do is complete the registration procedure, which involves approving two transactions from your wallet and paying the annual cost of $5 for names longer than five characters. You can generate various subdomains, such as email.rick.eth or website.rick.eth, all connected under the same ENS domain after you have the domain, link it to your websites, crypto wallets, etc.</p>



<p>Similar to the early days of DNS names, crypto locals are hurrying to obtain their nicknames, as ENS domains are limited. Some people are even experimenting with ENS domain flipping, which can be a successful side business, given that weather.eth was sold in the auction for 300 ETH, or US$27,000, while exchange.eth was sold for 6,660 ETH, or US$609,000.</p>



<p>Along with .eth, ENS also supports the most widely used DNS names, such as.com, .org, .io, .app, and others.</p>



<h2>What can you do with the ENS domain?</h2>



<p>In short, ENS domains assist users in converting their lengthy, difficult-to-read wallet addresses into identifiable names. Imagine using this to save someone&#8217;s phone number with their name. Then, to call the individual, you just need to type their name into the search bar; you don&#8217;t need to dial their number repeatedly. Similar to this, ENS greatly simplifies blockchain transactions, reducing the possibility of mistakes.</p>



<p>Once you have your domain, you may connect it to your websites, smart contracts, public wallets, or transactions. In addition, you can make subdomains, as the owner of an ENS domain, to connect to additional data. For example, email.lucy.eth or website.lucy.eth as examples.</p>



<h2>What makes ENS unique?</h2>



<p>The ENS is more secure, private, and resistant to censorship than the internet&#8217;s Domain Name Service (DNS) since it is built on Ethereum&#8217;s smart contracts. The team behind ENS believes that because internet naming infrastructure is so critical, it should be free, open, <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/can-decentralized-exchanges-dex-become-mainstream/" data-wpel-link="internal">decentralized</a>, community-driven, and not-for&#8211;profit. Technically speaking, the ENS can utilize the current Ethereum environment, making it highly programmable and able to communicate with other smart contracts in addition to naming.</p>



<p>Contrary to some of its opponents, the ENS does not seek to replace DNS. Instead, the main objective of the ENS is to provide distributed, reliable name resolution for Web3 resources, such as distributed content and blockchain addresses.</p>



<h2>Bottom line</h2>



<p>ENS enhances the field of decentralized networks by creating straightforward communication protocols with a blockchain. Just as how we no longer require IP addresses to access the web, we can see an increase in ENS names due to their usefulness and popularity.</p>

<p>In a world where monitoring is progressively tightened, where do cryptocurrencies stand? The most popular among cryptocurrencies is Bitcoin; however, it is simply pseudonymous and not anonymous. According to a recent discovery by one of the crypto exchanges, funds prove that the blockchain for Bitcoin is open to the public and transparent.</p>



<p>In other words, crypto-assets can be tracked if there are enough bits left behind to link a person&#8217;s identity with a wallet address. Monero (XMR) and ZCash (ZEC), two privacy currencies, are one approach to maintaining the cryptocurrency component of the market. But with so much money now committed everywhere, there are more sophisticated ways to guarantee that internet transactions stay secret, such as Tornado Cash (TORN).</p>



<p>In this blog, we will have an overview of Tornado Cash. Are you ready to deep dive?</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s go!</p>



<h1>Understanding Tornado Cash</h1>



<p>Tornado Cash is an Ethereum-based decentralized and non-custodial solution for privacy and anonymity. The anonymity of transactions is increased by severing the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/difference-between-on-chain-off-chain-transactions/" data-wpel-link="internal">on-chain</a> connection between coin senders and recipients.</p>



<p>Ethereum serves as a framework for decentralized protocols like Tornado Cash (TORN), which allows for anonymous token transfers. The Zcash privacy currency technology has contributed to the success of this token mixing platform. Tornado Cash uses Ethereum&#8217;s ERC-20 standard for transactions.</p>



<p>As a result, you may ask for coins to be sent to Tornado Cash and get money in your wallet in return. Since Ethereum is a public blockchain, this approach guarantees that your financial privacy is protected.</p>



<p>Tornado Cash leverages smart contracts to ensure anonymity by allowing token withdrawals from one address while accepting token deposits from another. These smart contracts function as pools that combine all assets that have been deposited.</p>



<p>When money is taken out of such pools by a brand-new address, the on-chain link between the source and the destination is severed. As a result, the removed crypto-assets are anonymous.</p>



<h2>A closer look at the working of Tornado Cash</h2>



<p>Tornado Cash is related to private cryptocurrencies like Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC), as you might expect. However, these privacy coins are private because they use zero-knowledge proof, a crucial component of cryptography.</p>



<p>ZKP, or Zero-Knowledge Proof, is the most secure kind of authentication that may be used.</p>



<p>Why? Since it doesn&#8217;t need the sharing of passwords. As a result, passwords cannot be compromised. In other words, ZKP enables users to authenticate themselves without disclosing their sensitive information.</p>



<p>The protocol is known as Zero-Knowledge Proof since the authentication doesn&#8217;t ask to reveal any secrets.</p>



<p>The so-called Yao&#8217;s Millionaires&#8217; problem is one of the most well-known examples used to illustrate ZKP. If two millionaires want to compare their financial situations without divulging their individual sums of money, they will use ZKP.</p>



<p>Any circumstance requiring proof of identification without knowledge follows the same general rule.</p>

<p>After the ZKP explanation, it is simple to comprehend how Tornado Cash functions. First, Tornado Cash generates a random key to deposit your ERC-20 crypto money, just like Alice (verifier) gives Bob (prover) an unexpected route back to prove his identity.</p>



<p>Tornado Cash breaks the on-chain connection between wallets by using this random key generation between the sender and the recipient. Technically speaking, Zcash and Tornado Cash both use a variant of ZKP known as zk-SNARK proofs (short for the zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge).</p>



<h2>Pros and Cons of Tornado Cash</h2>



<p><strong>PROS</strong></p>



<ul><li>Tornado Cash is a cryptocurrency &#8220;mixer,&#8221; or service that gathers coins and distributes them to new addresses. Unquestionably, this system&#8217;s <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/all-about-blockchain-interoperability/" data-wpel-link="internal">ERC-20 interoperability</a> is one of its key advantages.</li><li>On websites like CoinMarketCap, we can locate the system&#8217;s token, which is typically a technique to get more market traction.</li><li>Users that support the project&#8217;s privacy functions are rewarded with liquidity through the anonymity mining feature. This feature seems to be able to enhance the anonymization of transactions through Tornado Cash permanently.</li><li>Last but not least, Tornado Cash provides a relatively straightforward set of tools on the market for investors concerned about privacy. If you want to reach a huge market, user-friendliness is a crucial business component.</li></ul>



<p><strong>CONS</strong></p>



<ul><li>Since mixers have been around for a long, they don&#8217;t affect the game. Even if you utilize one, remember that it will make a lasting impression on your address.</li><li>Anyone can tell whether you use a mixer on your wallet by just browsing Etherscan. Evaluate if you are willing to take this risk.</li><li>Authorities may contact you about the situation as crypto law becomes more stringent. Regulators could query your use of a mixing service in the past. Those who decide to participate in illegal activities must accept the repercussions of their choices.</li><li>Among its drawbacks is the potential for a hacker to abuse the system. If lawmakers opt to tighten crypto regulations, Tornado Cash and similar alternatives will undoubtedly be at the center of the regulator&#8217;s evaluations.</li><li>Last, seasoned Tornado Cash users frequently criticize the absence of anonymity features.</li></ul>



<h2>Bottom line</h2>



<p>For some people who cherish their privacy, Tornado Cash might be a godsend. However, some users may occasionally find the anonymity offered by the service less than desirable. A service that helps customers maintain their identity and privacy is what Tornado Cash is. While doing so, it seeks to guarantee freedom from interference by outside authorities. The above section suggests the advantages and disadvantages of this <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/can-decentralized-exchanges-dex-become-mainstream/" data-wpel-link="internal">decentralized </a>cryptography system. Always have an open mind before you take any step and DYOR.</p>

<p>Pride month is about to get over; the NFT industry has not left a single stone unturned and emerged as an immense supporter of the LGBTQ+ community.</p>



<p>But, the question is: To support the LGBTQ+ NFT artists, do we really have to wait for the Pride month? Shouldn&#8217;t we support them all through the year? Since it is pride month, we have gathered a list of a few LGBTQ+ NFT artists you can support. Let&#8217;s have a look at them.</p>



<h2>NFT Industry and LGBTQ+ Community</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/the-pros-and-cons-of-nft-art/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFT</a> industry has won praise for its potential to provide an inclusive environment for artists from all backgrounds, including the LGBTQ+ community. Despite this, LGBTQ+ NFT artists are sadly underrepresented in the field. The industry certainly has a long way to go to shed its present boy&#8217;s club image. The whole NFT community is responsible for supporting current LGBTQ+ artists and providing room for newcomers in the midst of this.</p>



<p>So, to get this party started, let&#8217;s see who the 10 LGBTQ+ NFT artists of the Pride month you can support are.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Sam August Ng – TheyBalloons</strong></li></ol>



<p>Digital conceptual artist Sam August Ng, also known as TheyBalloons, identifies as non-binary. The London-based artist uses glitch arts, 3D, and vibrant hues to reinvent neo-expressionism in Web3.</p>



<p>The largest pride parade in the metaverse, Queer Frens, was co-founded by TheyBalloons. The 10,000 queer frogs in the collection, released in March 2022, were meant to encourage inclusion and diversity in the NFT community.</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Zak Krevitt &#8211; Museum of Queer</strong></li></ol>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/zak_krevitt" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Zak Krevitt</a> is a long-time supporter of LGBTQ+ groups. He has been working with, supporting, and raising money for his gay community&#8217;s diverse range of related issues for more than ten years. His art reflects his actual experiences—both public and private—and his love for gay advocacy.</p>



<p>Under the direction of Joseph Maida, Krevitt is a Professor at the School of Visual Arts Department of Photo and Video in New York City. He wants his students to develop a sense of action, adventure, community, and creative growth.</p>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Talia Rosa Abreu</strong></li></ol>

<ol start="4"><li><strong>Diana Sinclair &#8211; Her Story DAO</strong></li></ol>



<p>From NJ/NYC, Diana Sinclair is a Black queer photographer and artist who focuses on exploring and expressing identity. Diana is a great pioneer in the NFT industry in promoting diversity. Her advocacy has grown and impacted the world in tandem with her artistic career.</p>



<p>She has made an effort to include queer, trans, and Black Lives Matter in her artwork or to start other initiatives that support those issues because she is a firm supporter of those causes. Recently, she co-founded @<a href="https://twitter.com/herstoryDAO" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">herstorydao</a>, a DAO with the mission of preserving, nurturing, and celebrating the art and culture of underrepresented voices in the metaverse.</p>



<ol start="5"><li><strong>Dr. Brittany Jones &#8211; Queer Friends NFT</strong></li></ol>



<p>The <a href="https://queerfriendsnft.com/our-team/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Queer Friends NFT</a> project was developed, managed, and co-founded by Dr. Brittany Jones. Jones is a bisexual marine biologist who also plays sports and specializes in the study of dolphin communication. She previously taught young girls about science and STEAM (science, technology, engineering, the arts, and math) jobs via digital art.</p>



<ol start="6"><li><strong>PapiCandlez &#8211; The CryptoCandlez</strong></li></ol>



<p>PapiCandlez is a gay illustrator and animator located in Los Angeles. He just released the TheCryptoCandlez collection on OpenSea. A total of 103 candles in various charming avatars are included in the collection.</p>



<ol start="7"><li><strong>Jesse Soleil</strong></li></ol>



<p>Jesse Soleil is a 2D and 3D artist who has sold 17 unique NFTs in their career in crypto. Jesse calls what they do &#8220;digital therapy.&#8221; We eagerly await what they have in mind for us because they have become a crucial part of the NFT community.</p>



<ol start="8"><li><strong>Stacie A Buhler &#8211; Ugly Berts &amp; Bettys</strong></li></ol>



<p><a href="https://www.stacieabuhler.com/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Stacie A. Buhler</a> is a Los Angeles-based fashion photographer and NFT artist who describes her work as &#8220;relaxed, joyful, friendly, and accessible to all.&#8221; She founded Ugly NFTs, which has Ugly Bettys and Ugly Berts. Her personal experiences, in which both men and women informed her they didn&#8217;t like the way she dressed, served as inspiration for the collection.</p>



<p>Each NFT in the series has also been digitally hand-painted by Stacie. The project&#8217;s description states that</p>



<p>&#8220;This NFT collection is based on model diversity and LGTBQ+ rights and exposure within the fashion industry.&#8221;</p>



<ol start="9"><li><strong>Katherina (Kate The Cursed) &#8211; aGENDAdao</strong></li></ol>

<ol start="10"><li><strong>Vanshika Dhyani &#8211; The Desi Dulhan Club</strong></li></ol>



<p>Vanshika Dhyani is an Asian, bisexual, and neurodivergent artist. To bring attention to child marriages, dowry murders, honor killings, and female infanticides that have a place in South Asia, she established The Desi Dulhan Club NFT collection.</p>



<p>She started the initiative as a way to remember her grandmother, who was married off at the age of 13. In addition, the &#8220;Desi Dulhans&#8221; in the series lack lips to symbolize how women in South Asia are silenced. In contrast, the eyes have a &#8220;deer in headlights&#8221; appearance to convey a &#8220;frightened and uncertain&#8221; look.</p>



<p>According to Dhyani, this collection aims to inspire individuals to volunteer with UNICEF in South Asia to uplift, empower, and educate women.</p>



<h2>Bottom line</h2>



<p>The article showcases only a few <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/bollywood-stars-and-their-nfts-2/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFT artists</a>, and there are so many other amazing artists worldwide. In addition, you may support various LGBTQ+ NFT artists during this pride month and beyond. So don&#8217;t wait for anything; go and show your love and support!</p>

<p>The Finance Bill of 2022 introduced a new section called 194S in the Income-Tax Act, 1961, to levy 1% TDS on any consideration paid for the transfer of Virtual Digital Assets (VDA). Simply put, when you buy any Crypto (Crypto is considered a VDA), you (or the Exchange facilitating this transaction) will have to deduct and withhold 1% of the transaction value as TDS. This withheld Tax will have to be further paid to the Government.</p>



<p>Before we go into the details, here is a piece of good news for you: The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has clarified that when someone is buying Crypto via an Exchange (even in the case of P2P transactions), Tax can be deducted under section 194S by the Exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Making it simple; technically, you as a buyer or seller will not have to do anything. WazirX will do the needful. However, your support to make the process smooth might be expected. We at WazirX are upgrading our systems to support this mechanism and will keep you posted.</p>



<p>To help you understand these provisions better, here are a few explanations with examples:</p>



<ul><li>TDS provisions are applicable from <strong>1 July 2022</strong>. These provisions will not affect any trades executed before 1 July 2022. As per these provisions, TDS would be deducted on each trade where a Crypto asset is exchanged for INR or another Crypto asset. </li></ul>



<p><strong>Please Note</strong>: If you have placed orders before the 1st of July 2022, but the trade happens on or after the 1st of July 2022, the TDS provisions will apply.</p>



<p></p>



<ul><li>No TDS would be deducted from the buyer on buying Crypto using INR, while the seller of the Crypto asset would be liable to pay TDS. However, when a Crypto asset is bought by paying with another Crypto asset, i.e., trading one Crypto asset for another, the TDS would be payable by both sides.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p></p>



<ul><li>Wherever applicable, <strong>1% TDS</strong> will be deducted from the receivable INR or Crypto amount. However, as per Section 206AB of the Income-Tax Act, 1961, if the user has not filed their Income Tax Return in the last 2 years and the amount of TDS is ₹50,000 or more in each of these two previous years, then the TDS to be deducted (for Crypto-related transactions) will be at 5%. For simplicity, in the rest of this blog, we will use 1% as the rate of TDS.</li></ul>



<p></p>



<ul><li>The TDS collected needs to be paid to the Income Tax Department in the form of INR. For this, any TDS collected in the form of Crypto has to be converted to INR. For ease of conversion and to reduce price slippage, in Crypto to Crypto transactions, the TDS for both sides would be deducted in the quote (or primary) Crypto asset. WazirX markets have 4 quote assets- INR, USDT, BTC, and WRX. For example, in the following markets: MATIC-BTC, ETH-BTC, and ADA-BTC, BTC is the quote Crypto asset, and hence the TDS of both the buyer and seller trading in these markets would be deducted in BTC.<ul><li>Examples:<ul><li>INR markets: 1 BTC traded for 100 INR. BTC seller receives 99 INR (after 1% TDS deduction). BTC buyer receives 1 BTC (no TDS deducted).</li><li>Crypto-Crypto markets: 1 BTC sold for 10 ETH. BTC seller receives 10 ETH by paying 1.01 BTC (after 1% TDS addition). BTC buyer receives 0.99 BTC (after 1% TDS deduction).</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>



<p></p>



<ul><li>In P2P trades. 1% TDS would be deducted before a USDT sell order is placed. No TDS has to be paid by the P2P USDT buyer.<ul><li>Examples:<ul><li>Seller places an order for selling 100 USDT. Post 1% TDS deduction, a sell order would be placed for 99 USDT. The buyer would pay for 99 USDT, and the corresponding INR would be transferred to the seller&#8217;s bank account by the buyer.</li><li>If the entire 99 USDT is not successfully sold, 1% TDS would be deducted only in proportion to the amount sold, and the remaining of the 1 USDT locked for TDS would be released back to the seller on order cancellation.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>



<p></p>



<ul><li>The TDS will be calculated on the ‘net’ consideration payable after excluding GST/charges levied by the Exchange.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p></p>



<ul><li>Any TDS collected in Crypto would be periodically converted into INR, and the INR value received would be updated against the respective trades.</li></ul>



<p></p>



<ul><li>To make things more transparent, the TDS deducted would be specified on the order details page immediately after trade execution. In cases where the TDS is deducted in the form of any crypto asset, the corresponding INR value of the TDS deducted can be found in the trading report after 48hrs.</li></ul>



<p></p>



<ul><li>TDS would not be applicable on the trades performed on WazirX by a broker platform if the broker is deducting the TDS itself and it has an appropriate written agreement with WazirX specifying the same.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Please Note</strong>: For consistency and simplicity of implementation, the above-described approach of deducting tax on&nbsp;Crypto trades would be applicable to all users irrespective of their trading volume during the financial year.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies have become incredibly popular all across the world in recent years. Even though the industry has seen many ups and downs, individuals have demonstrated their faith and trust, which has enabled the sector to expand at a tremendous rate. However, as time goes on, more and more individuals are interested in learning about technology and other forms of digital currencies, like wrapped bitcoin.</p>



<p>Bitcoin and Ethereum are cryptocurrencies that utilize blockchains. Now, several blockchains have various features, functions, and protocols. Unfortunately, they are not able to communicate with one another as a result of this discrepancy. While this improves the security of a blockchain-based digital asset, it makes it extremely difficult to build an interoperable exchange that allows for data transfer from one cryptocurrency into another.</p>



<h2>Why wrapped cryptocurrency idea was born?</h2>



<p>There were issues with the native tokens for Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, information exchange between cryptocurrencies is essential for <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/is-this-the-endgame-of-decentralization-in-defi/" data-wpel-link="internal">Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</a> to exist. Therefore, the industry needs to resolve the communication problem between the oldest and largest cryptocurrency networks, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, for Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) to handle such transactions efficiently. Although, some recent blockchains, like Polkadot, have attempted to address the interoperability issue.</p>



<h2>Introduction to wrapped cryptocurrency</h2>



<p>Here comes wrapped cryptocurrency into play. Simply put, a wrapped token symbolizes a cryptocurrency built on a different blockchain with the same value as the original cryptocurrency. Still, it may be used on non-native blockchains and afterward redeemed for the original cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>To put things into context, Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) is a digital token with the same value as one Bitcoin that is based on the Ethereum blockchain and can therefore be used in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem, which is primarily based on the Ethereum blockchain technology. It is also based on the ERC-20 standard.</p>



<h2>What makes wrapped cryptocurrency unique?</h2>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/all-about-blockchain-interoperability/" data-wpel-link="internal">Interoperability</a> across blockchains is provided through wrapped cryptocurrencies like WBTC, allowing users to move assets quickly and use other blockchains&#8217; functions and applications. These benefits might include quicker transaction times, reduced fees, or increased potential for farming.</p>



<p>Bridges, a technology that enables you to wrap your cryptocurrencies to transfer them across blockchains, have been growing as the number of wrapped cryptocurrencies like WBTC in circulation has been continuously rising.</p>



<h2>How are wrapped cryptocurrencies (like WBTC) produced?</h2>



<p>The WBTC DAO&#8217;s governing members decide on significant protocol updates and modifications, as well as who can take on the duties of the merchants and custodians who oversee the system.</p>



<p>Users must communicate with merchants to exchange their BTC for WBTC. By carrying out authentication processes to verify consumers&#8217; identities, merchants start the process of minting or burning WBTC tokens. The real tokens are minted and burned on the Ethereum blockchain by custodians, who also retain the BTC that is being wrapped.</p>



<p>The custodian gives BTC back to the user when WBTC is burnt. When a new WBTC is created, the custodian takes BTC from the user and stores it.</p>



<h2>How does the wrapped cryptocurrency work?</h2>



<p>Wrapped cryptocurrencies are generated and eradicated by a process called &#8220;<a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-nft-minting/" data-wpel-link="internal">minting</a>&#8221; and &#8220;burning.&#8221; The underlying asset, in this instance BTC, is transferred to a custodian who holds it in a virtual safe to mint a wrapped cryptocurrency like WBTC. A comparable quantity of WBTC can be minted when the underlying BTC has been secured.</p>



<p>This process is also known as &#8220;wrapping.&#8221; A smart contract is being used to &#8220;wrap up&#8221; the underlying asset in a digital vault, and a new wrapped asset is minted to be used on another blockchain.</p>



<p>A similar process is used, but in reverse, to burn WBTC. The corresponding amount of BTC is released from the online vault and put back into circulation in place of the WBTC, which is taken out of circulation.</p>



<p>Burning wrapped tokens may be compared to &#8220;unwrapping&#8221; the underlying item, just as minting wrapped cryptocurrency can be compared to &#8220;wrapping&#8221; the underlying asset to generate a token of comparable value for usage on another blockchain.</p>



<h2>Final thoughts: What does the future look like?</h2>



<p>The industry has a hurdle in achieving interoperability across various blockchains.</p>



<p>One issue is that when more blockchains are developed, the number of bridges required to ensure that assets on one blockchain may quickly move to every other blockchain exponentially rises, as was mentioned in the section above.</p>



<p>To attempt to make bridging assets across blockchains more straightforward and more effective, solutions are being created.</p>



<p>In the near future, at least bridges and wrapped cryptocurrencies are anticipated to be a vital component of the interoperability solution.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Crypto debit cards are the easiest way to spend your Crypto instead of HODLing it.</p></blockquote>



<p>You might intend to spend part of your holdings if you invested in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, or other Cryptocurrencies. However, with the help of Crypto debit cards, customers may find it simpler to use Cryptocurrencies with merchants that do not accept them outright.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s start our journey by understanding the Crypto debit cards.</p>



<h2>Crypto debit cards: An introduction</h2>



<p>Even if most people are aware of what a debit card is, it&#8217;s still important to define it because a Crypto debit card is founded on the same idea. A plastic debit card with your vital account information integrated into it through a chip or scannable barcode is known as a debit card. A debit card can electronically pay for products and services using the funds in the associated account, unlike a credit card.</p>



<p>A debit card establishes a connection between processing firms and your checking account, enabling retailers to process payments using the money in your account.</p>



<p>A Crypto debit card is exactly what it sounds like, so there you have it. A Crypto debit card links your Cryptocurrency wallet to a business that processes Cryptocurrency payments.</p>



<p>With this card, you may use the money in your <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/different-kinds-of-crypto-wallets/" data-wpel-link="internal">Cryptocurrency wallet</a> to complete transactions at any business that accepts debit cards.</p>



<p>A significant difference between a Crypto debit card and a conventional debit card is that the former instantly converts the Cryptocurrency you will be using to your selected fiat currency.</p>



<h2>How does a Crypto debit card work?</h2>



<p>Using a smart mechanism, Crypto debit cards let cardholders use their Cryptocurrency as though it were a kind of money, even though it isn&#8217;t recognized. A Crypto wallet will be connected to your Cryptocurrency debit card. Depending on the card, this wallet may be linked to one or more of your personal Crypto wallets, your Crypto exchange assets, or it might be directly pre-loaded with money from a conventional debit card.</p>



<p>At the time of sale or ATM withdrawal, these debit cards sell some of those digital assets on your behalf and transform them into fiat money. So, in essence, the card forces you to keep it pre-loaded with a particular Cryptocurrency or sells some of your Cryptos and transforms them into cash when you use them.</p>



<h2>Features to consider before choosing a Crypto debit card</h2>



<p>Following is a list of features that you should consider before choosing a Crypto debit card</p>



<ul><li><strong>Fees:</strong> Many Crypto debit cards include fees, but not all of them. Fees for overseas transactions, monthly maintenance, and ATM withdrawals are a few examples. It would help if you selected a card with the fewest potential costs.</li><li><strong>Rewards:</strong> Some Crypto debit cards provide bonuses like cashback on Cryptocurrencies. Look for cards with big cash back because these benefits can significantly increase your earning potential.</li><li><strong>Supported currencies:</strong> Other currencies are not always supported by Crypto debit cards. You should select a card that supports the kind of Cryptocurrency you desire.</li><li><strong>Availability:</strong> Some Crypto debit cards are exclusively accessible in specific regions, such as the EU or the US. Find a debit card that is accepted in your area.</li><li><strong>Other perks:</strong> Additional benefits for Bitcoin debit cards are a fantastic extra reward. These can range from standard benefits like refunded ATM costs to unusual ones like free Spotify subscriptions.</li></ul>



<p>Let&#8217;s move forward with understanding the pros and cons of Crypto debit cards.</p>



<h2>Pros and cons of Crypto debit cards</h2>



<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Ability to use Cryptocurrencies just like fiat money</li><li>Reduced or eliminated foreign exchange costs</li><li>Multi-currency generally enables diverse spending</li><li>Some cards provide significant cashback incentives in Cryptocurrency.</li><li>Some issuers may waive ATM withdrawal fees.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>



<ul><li>A taxable event is started when Cryptocurrency is spent.</li><li>There are certain geographical limitations.</li><li>To spend, your wallet must have funds.</li></ul>



<h2>Should you get a Crypto debit card for yourself?</h2>



<p>Your <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/blockassets-a-comprehensive-analysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">Cryptocurrency assets</a> and the value of the card you&#8217;re contemplating as far as fees and other criteria are concerned will determine if you should acquire a Crypto debit card.</p>



<p>A Crypto debit card can make sense for you if you&#8217;re searching for a means to turn your Cryptocurrency into cash.</p>



<h2>Final thoughts: Are they safe to use?</h2>



<p>With additional security features like two-factor authentication, biometric scanning, and mobile codes, most Crypto debit cards are as secure to use as most major credit cards. In addition, through a mobile app, cardholders typically may immediately freeze or cancel their card.</p>



<p>However, some believe offline digital wallets are safer than Crypto debit cards. Technically, maintaining money in mobile wallets or online exchanges and moving money from a wallet to the company that issues debit cards can raise the danger of cyber-attacks.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Justin Sun, the founder of TRON, tweeted in April about the launch of the brand-new stablecoin on the TRON blockchain, USDD (or Decentralized USD), marking its official entry into the field of decentralized stablecoin.</p></blockquote>



<p>As an algorithmic stablecoin, USDD is comparable to UST, the Terra stablecoin that, up until the beginning of May, was the biggest of its kind. Considering how fresh it is, it could seem intimidating to think about investing in the TRON stablecoin. We&#8217;ll discover more about USDD in this blog, including how it works and whether you should invest in it or not.</p>



<p>Are you all set to get this party started? Let&#8217;s go!</p>



<p>Before meeting USDD, let&#8217;s have a quick catch-up with algorithmic stablecoin.</p>



<h2>What are algorithmic stablecoins?</h2>



<p>Cryptocurrencies known as <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-are-stablecoins/" data-wpel-link="internal">stablecoins</a> are intended to maintain a specific value in relation to another asset, usually a fiat currency like the US dollar. Investors and traders frequently use stablecoins to stay in the crypto market while hedging against price volatility since they are tied to an expected and stable value. In addition, most stablecoins try to establish their peg utilizing a collateral mechanism of some kind.</p>



<p>Algorithmic stablecoins are different. In their most basic form, algorithmic stablecoins are fully uncollateralized. They have no outside asset to support their worth. Instead, they employ algorithms, which are detailed guidelines or instructions that must be followed for a given outcome (usually by a computer). These algorithms are designed to reward market participants&#8217; behavior and/or alter the amount of coins in circulation, causing the price of any particular currency to, in theory, settle around the peg.</p>



<p>AMPL, BAC, USDD, UXD, and UST are some well-known algorithmic stablecoins. We&#8217;ll learn about USDD in this blog.</p>



<h2>Introduction to USDD stablecoin</h2>



<p>On May 5, 2022, <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-tron/" data-wpel-link="internal">TRON stablecoin</a> and digital asset USDD went live on Ethereum and TRON. The creator of TRON, Justin Sun, asserted that USDD would provide investors with a 30% annual percentage yield. Furthermore, it is maintained at a 1:1 ratio to the US dollar, which means that 1 USDD is always expected to be equal to $1. This means that USDD retains its value at a fixed exchange rate to the US dollar.</p>



<p>Because both USDD and UST are algorithmic stablecoins, which maintain price stability using algorithms and smart contracts that can control the number of tokens in circulation, USDD has historically been equated to UST.</p>



<p>Once the price falls below its desired level, the algorithmic stablecoin system reduces the total number of tokens available. Conversely, more tokens will be made available if the token&#8217;s price rises above the desired level to cause the stablecoin&#8217;s value to fall to the desired level. The major purpose of using an algorithmic stablecoin is to have better control over a coin&#8217;s supply and demand.</p>



<h2>How does USDD work?</h2>



<p>Without getting into the specifics, the USDD stablecoin essentially pledges the following to keep its parity with the US dollar:</p>



<p><strong>When the price surges beyond the peg</strong></p>



<p>Consider a situation where there is more demand than supply for USD. Then, as a result of market dynamics, the price will exceed $1.</p>



<p>The USDD protocol allows users to temporarily exchange $1 worth of TRX for 1 USDD to return the price to $1. TRX worth $1 is burned in this trade, and 1 USDD is created. The increase in USDD supply resulting from more users doing these swaps causes the price to stabilize at $1 per token.</p>



<p>It should be noted that consumers are motivated to engage actively in the process. This is because these TRX-to-USDD swaps provide consumers with an opportunity to profit from arbitrage.</p>



<p>For instance, if the USDD price increases to $1, the new USDD you created by exchanging $1 worth of TRX will likewise be valued at $1.1 on a market outside of the network. Then, by selling that USDD, you may generate a profit of ($1.1 &#8211; $1.0 =) $0.1. This may not seem very much, but if done frequently, the earnings can increase significantly.</p>



<p><strong>When the price drops below the peg</strong></p>



<p>Similarly, if the USDD price falls below $1 (let&#8217;s say to $0.9), you may purchase 1 USDD on the open market for just $0.9. Then, under the protocol, you may exchange 1 USDD for 1 TRX. Each exchange causes 1 USDD to be burned in the system, which lowers the amount of USDD in circulation.</p>



<p>As more users switch from USDD to TRX, the supply finally declines. The price then returns to the desired level, which is $1, as a result.</p>



<p>Regarding the rewards for taking part in the process, you might now sell your $1 worth of TRX on a public market to earn ($1- $0.9 =) $0.1 every swap.</p>



<h2>Bottom line</h2>



<p>You now have the knowledge necessary to decide whether the USDD stablecoin is ideal for you and your crypto portfolio since you better understand what USDD is. Despite being a relatively new stablecoin, it has certain unique benefits that might prove valuable in the future. The USDD stablecoin and the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/ust-could-take-luna-to-the-moon/" data-wpel-link="internal">UST stablecoin</a> are both algorithmic coins. This can be the foundation of your USDD investments if you know how to use UST appropriately.</p>



<p>Happy investing!</p>

<p>This year, Shiba Inu will release several new products, including ShibaSwap 2.0 in its entirety, SHIB the Metaverse, a partnership with PlaySide Games, and a play-2-earn blockchain game. Additionally, SHIBARIUM, a layer 2 solution, is the most anticipated release of them all.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The catchphrase &#8220;When Robinhood?&#8221; has been replaced by &#8220;When Shibarium?&#8221; for everyone.</p></blockquote>



<p>Before we jump on the bandwagon of Shibarium, let&#8217;s look at Shiba Inu and the top reasons for its popularity.</p>



<h2>Introduction to SHIBA INU</h2>



<p>The Shiba Inu, a Japanese hunting dog breed, acts as the mascot of <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/SHIB-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Shiba Inu (SHIB)</a>, an Ethereum-based altcoin (a cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin). Shiba Inu is frequently mentioned as a Dogecoin substitute; its supporters even refer to it as &#8220;the Dogecoin killer.&#8221;</p>



<p>Shiba Inu and Dogecoin are examples of meme coins, which are digital currencies tied to a particular theme—in the case of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, the Shiba Inu dog—but which are frequently presented as inside jokes or parodies rather than as useful digital products.</p>



<p>While Dogecoin was introduced in December 2013, Ryoshi, a pseudonymous person or organization, introduced Shiba Inu in August 2020.</p>



<h2>Top reasons behind Shiba Inu&#8217;s fame</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Its origin</strong></li></ul>



<p>Shiba Inu is a meme currency that has its origin in internet trends and memes. It was introduced as Dogecoin&#8217;s immediate rival. What started as a community-driven coin symbolizing a meme soon snowballed into a multi-billion dollar crypto business.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Its mechanism</strong></li></ul>



<p>There is no internal blockchain infrastructure at Shiba Inu. Instead, it is based on the Ethereum blockchain that already exists. Since Ethereum is &#8220;secure and well-established,&#8221; Ryoshi chose that platform to develop this meme coin. As a result, Shiba Inu became decentralized; as a result, making it available to a vast user base.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Its ecosystem</strong></li></ul>



<p>The Shiba Inu ecosystem consists of three tokens — the namesake token (SHIB), which is its primary and most essential token, Leash (LEASH) and Bone (BONE).</p>



<p>With almost one quadrillion tokens, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is the image of the ecosystem. Therefore, it would seem rational to assume that the token asset of Shiba Inu&#8217;s mysterious inventor Ryoshi would have no boundaries.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Utility and support</strong></li></ul>



<p>It is true that famous meme coins have short-lived popularity and are primarily reliant on online hype. The Shiba token, however, goes a step further. ShibaSwap, a <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/tradfi-vs-defi/" data-wpel-link="internal">Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</a> platform, is one of the many utility components that SHIB offers, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Its goal is to make cryptocurrency trading safe and secure while maintaining a decentralized system.</p>



<p>Shiba Inu, known for a while as the &#8220;Dogecoin killer,&#8221; is also building a Layer 2 protocol called Shibarium to include more utilities and improve the trading process&#8217;s efficiency.</p>



<ul><li><strong>The Elon Musk touch</strong></li></ul>



<p>Elon Musk, the creator of Tesla, can shift the balance in the crypto world with just one tweet.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="de" dir="ltr">Floki Frunkpuppy <a href="https://t.co/xAr8T0Jfdf" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/xAr8T0Jfdf</a></p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1444840184500129797?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">October 4, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div><figcaption>Source: Twitter</figcaption></figure>



<p>He posted this picture of a Shiba Inu puppy on October 4, 2021, which caused the value of the meme coin to increase. It has periodically actually <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/all-you-need-to-know-about-shiba-inu-taking-over-dogecoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">overtaken Dogecoin</a> in rankings in the past.</p>



<p>Now, let&#8217;s have an overview of Shibarium.</p>



<h2>Everything you need to know about Shibarium</h2>



<p>Shibarium is a blockchain platform that enables users and developers to construct original applications for already-existing blockchain infrastructure. Ethereum is one instance that contains a built-in coin called ether (ETH). However, the Ethereum blockchain also enables the development of programmable tokens for initial coin offerings (ICOs), smart contracts, and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). They are constructed around the Ethereum network&#8217;s infrastructure and are protected by nodes.</p>



<p><strong>Purpose: </strong>A safe and open platform for the creation and trade of digital assets is what the Shibarium blockchain is intended to offer. It also aims to provide a base for creating Decentralized Applications (DApps).</p>



<p><strong>Differentiating factor:</strong> Shibarium Blockchain&#8217;s focus on companies sets it apart from other blockchains. It is the best blockchain for businesses looking to embrace the technology since it processes transactions more quickly and charges cheaper costs than other blockchains.</p>



<p><strong>Pros of Shibarium blockchain:</strong></p>



<ul><li><strong>Security:</strong> The Shibarium blockchain is a secure and tamper-proof platform where sensitive data can be stored and transmitted.</li><li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Users can follow all transactions and activity on this blockchain because it is a transparent platform.</li><li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Transactions are processed swiftly and efficiently using this blockchain, which is a prompt and efficient platform.</li><li><strong>Cost-effective:</strong> Businesses can reduce their transaction fees by using this blockchain, which is a cost-effective platform.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Is it decentralized?</strong></p>



<p>Since no single party has control over the Shibarium blockchain, it is decentralized. Instead, a network of computers equipped with copies of the blockchain is used to maintain it. This guarantees that the blockchain cannot be altered by a single person and is tamper-proof.</p>



<p><strong>Is it secure?</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/ethereums-transition-to-proof-of-stake-pos/" data-wpel-link="internal">proof-of-stake</a> method that protects the Shibarium blockchain compels users to stake their Shibarium tokens to utilize the network. Ensuring that users have a stake in the network&#8217;s success this assists in network security. The Shibarium blockchain is further protected by a network of nodes that provide transaction validation and maintain the blockchain&#8217;s current state.</p>



<h2>Final thoughts</h2>



<p>Shibarium, a layer-2 solution, offers several advantages. The introduction of Shibarium will, most notably, reduce transaction fees. The Ethereum blockchain serves as the core for SHIB. Its petrol prices have therefore been far higher than everyone would prefer. Ethereum&#8217;s creators are working on a significant update to solve the problem. Shiba Inu might, however, find an even faster solution to the issue with Shibarium.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Circle, a global online financial company and the creator of USD Coin (USDC), has stated that it is planning to launch Euro Coin, a fully-reserved, Euro-pegged stablecoin (EUROC).</p></blockquote>



<p>Euro Coin is a regulated, Euro-backed stablecoin that will be accessible on June 30, 2022, and will be produced under the same full-reserve model and constructed on the same foundations of trust, faith, transparency, and security that have made USDC one of the world&#8217;s leading digital currencies.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/circle-announces-a-fully-reserved-euro-backed-stablecoin-euro-coin-euroc-301569124.html" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">debut of Euro Coin</a> intends to build on Circle&#8217;s success in enabling frictionless financial value exchange and bridging the gap between crypto-native and traditional financial services. Businesses may utilize EUROC tokens to shift Euro liquidity on-chain, accept and make worldwide Euro payments that settle in minutes, and leverage crypto capital markets for trading, borrowing, lending, and more.</p>



<p>Starting with Silvergate Bank, Euro Coin is entirely backed by Euro-denominated reserves stored conservatively in the custody of renowned financial institutions inside the US regulatory perimeter.</p>



<p>Before diving deeper, let&#8217;s get an overview of Circle, the global internet finance firm.</p>



<h2>An introduction to Circle</h2>



<p>Circle, a Boston-based financial services firm that employs blockchain technology for peer-to-peer payments and crypto-related businesses was founded in 2013.</p>



<p>The company, which started as a consumer-facing P2P payment and cryptocurrency wallet and exchange software, has changed its focus to commercial blockchain and crypto applications. In 2018, Circle announced the USD Coin (USDC), a stablecoin backed by $1 or an asset of equivalent, fair value.</p>



<h2>The Ins &amp; Outs of EUROC</h2>



<p></p>



<ul><li>The Euro Coin (EUROC) will be entirely backed by Euro-denominated reserves held by financial organizations &#8220;within the US regulatory perimeter.&#8221;</li></ul>



<ul><li>EUROC joins a list of Euro-backed stablecoins, including <a href="https://tether.to/en/transparency/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Tether&#8217;s EURt</a> and Malta&#8217;s Stasis&#8217; EURS. Tether is the creator of USDT, the biggest dollar-pegged coin, with a market valuation of more than $70 billion, compared to $54 billion for USDC.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Euro Coin is a regulated, Euro-backed stablecoin based on the same full-reserve mechanism and foundations of trust, transparency, and security that have established USDC as one of the most trusted digital currencies in the world.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Euro Coin will be available as an ERC-20 standard token on the Ethereum network on June 30. Later this year, support for other blockchains is expected. According to the release, several platforms, including Binance.US, will support the stablecoin at launch.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The Euro coin and the USDC are designed to open up new possibilities for on-change foreign exchange and multi-currency digital finance by allowing smooth, quick, and low-cost transactions.</li></ul>



<h2>Who can use the Euro Coin?</h2>



<p></p>



<ul><li><strong>Exchanges</strong></li></ul>



<p>Customers may convert Euros to Euro Coin on exchanges, providing access to new digital asset trading pairings and near-instant stablecoin FX.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Institutional traders</strong></li></ul>



<p>Make trades with Euro Coin and profit from arbitrage possibilities on digital asset exchanges and in decentralized finance (DeFi).</p>



<ul><li><strong>Businesses</strong></li></ul>



<p>Accepting Euro Coin payments will help you extend your consumer base and increase your cash flow. Pay suppliers, vendors, and workers worldwide with funds that can settle in moments.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Individuals</strong></li></ul>



<p>Pay for items at participating retailers, send money to friends and family across borders swiftly, and utilize Euro Coin throughout the Web3 ecosystem.</p>



<h2>Why was Euro chosen?</h2>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.bis.org/statistics/rpfx19_fx.htm" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Bank for International Settlements</a> (BIS), the Euro is the world&#8217;s second-biggest fiat currency in terms of foreign exchange turnover. Moreover, the Euro was on one side of 32% of all currency exchanges, according to the BIS&#8217; 2019 Triennial Central Bank Survey.</p>



<p>The Euro is the unified currency of the Eurozone&#8217;s 19 members, having been introduced in 1999. Its dominance as a trading pair is shown in the United States Dollar Index, or DXY, which has a weighting of 57.6 percent.</p>



<h2>Why was EUROC introduced as another stablecoin?</h2>



<p>The launch of EUROC came at a time when users of stablecoins were experiencing considerable speculation and a lack of trust. These worries follow the collapse of the TerraUSD (USTC) stablecoin and fears about Tether (USDT) briefly falling below a dollar.</p>



<p>Unlike EUROC, which will be fully backed by reserves such as USDC, the Euro-pegged stablecoin&#8217;s reserves will be fully backed by Euros.</p>



<p>This appears to be the primary distinction between the EUROC and the USDC, which is backed by cash and short-term US government bonds.</p>



<p>As a result, for each EUROC token in use, a reserve in Euros will be maintained in custody at financial firms subject to US regulatory control. The first custodian for the EUROC stablecoin will be Silvergate Bank.</p>

<h2>Bottom line</h2>



<p>Businesses can start minting Euro Coin on June 30 by depositing Euros into their Circle Account over Silvergate&#8217;s Euro SEN network. Later this year, more deposit choices are likely to become available.</p>



<p>Euro Coin will be open to non-Circle Account users via digital asset exchanges and DeFi protocols once trading commences. Click <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/euro-coin" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">here</a> to stay up-to-date on this!</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency is now becoming mainstream. You can always pay in cryptocurrency, whether you wish to trade Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) or buy food. Paying using cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, is a little more complicated. First, users are forced to pay gas costs while transacting on the Ethereum network. Users pay miners compensation for the computational power required to validate a transaction.</p>



<p>Gas prices, commonly known as &#8220;gwei,&#8221; can range from $5 to $150 in a matter of seconds. Its high pricing has been a sore spot for consumers who are devoted to Ethereum. In this article, we&#8217;ll look at gas fees, why they&#8217;re so high, and how to avoid paying excessive Ethereum gas prices.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s start our journey by understanding what gas fees is.</p>



<h2>What is a gas fees?</h2>



<p>The gas fees is the fee, or pricing value, necessary to complete a transaction or execute a contract on the Ethereum blockchain platform. Priced in small portions of the cryptocurrency, ether (ETH) is referred to as Gwei, often known as nanoeth. The gas fees is used to distribute resources to the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-ethereum-virtual-machine-evm/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum Virtual Machine</a> (EVM), allowing Decentralized Applications (DApps) like smart contracts to operate in a secure but decentralized manner.</p>



<h2>How are gas fees determined?</h2>



<p>The real gas price is determined by supply and demand among network miners, who can decline to complete a transaction if the gas price falls below their threshold, and network users looking for processing power.</p>



<p>Miners can refuse to execute a transaction if the gas limit (the maximum amount of gas costs a user is prepared to pay on the transaction) established by the user is not acceptable to them.</p>



<p>On Ethereum, the transaction fee is divided into three parts:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Base fee:</strong> It is the very minimum amount required for a transaction.</li><li><strong>Gas limit:</strong> It is the smallest amount of money (configurable) that a user is prepared to spend for a transaction.</li><li><strong>Tip:</strong> It is a small fee you pay to get your transaction expedited by miners.</li></ul>



<p>This is how it usually works: all of Ethereum&#8217;s unprocessed transactions are moved to the &#8220;mempool,&#8221; a memory pool. Then, miners select the transactions they wish to validate there.</p>



<h2>The reason behind the high gas fees</h2>



<p>Many blockchain software developers build their ideas on Ethereum, which is the most prominent blockchain for smart contracts. Imagine how these smart contracts can represent complete exchanges, NFT collections, DAOs, and <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/metaverse-vs-virtual-reality/" data-wpel-link="internal">Metaverses</a>. Each of these unique protocols or initiatives has the potential to handle millions of transactions each day.</p>



<p>The maximum block limit is gradually reached when users of various projects conduct transactions and other procedures on the identical blockchain. Users that want their transactions processed quickly may pay additional tips, making the process of being included in a block even more competitive. On some days of the week, when there is less traffic on the blockchain, it is feasible to get comparable cheap gas fees. However, transactions on the blockchain can quickly fill up space, increasing gas prices over time.</p>



<h2>Tips to avoid high gas fees</h2>



<p>Here are four ways you can spend less on gas on Ethereum:</p>



<ol><li><strong>With DeFi saver, use simulation</strong></li></ol>



<p>You won&#8217;t know the actual cost of gas until you complete the transaction and pay for it. You might, however, imitate your transactions with the DeFi Saver software. You&#8217;ll need first to develop an Ethereum activity process and then run it virtually.</p>



<p>The real-world simulation will give you a due and maximum gas fee in ETH. You may then tailor your entire approach to save money on gas. Execute your method on the Ethereum platform now to save money on gas.</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Optimized smart contracts</strong></li></ol>



<p>The smart contract can be optimized, which is a less extreme method. However, the more complicated the smart contract, the higher the cost is. As a result, a smart contract should be as straightforward and concise as possible. Remove all unnecessary functions and examine the code to see if it can be reduced. Perhaps even test whether some operations, such as whitelist management, could be performed outside the smart contract.</p>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Using Layer 2 scaling solutions</strong></li></ol>



<p>Due to congestion, transactions on the Ethereum Mainnet (layer-one) are costly. Therefore, <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/layer-2-scaling-solutions-a-revolution-in-the-blockchain-world/" data-wpel-link="internal">layer-two solutions</a> are available to assist users in scaling up transactions.</p>



<p>On this network, layer-2 uses technologies like Rollups and moving transactions to sidechains. As a result, this new procedure saves money on gas and speeds up transaction completion. Some well-known layer-two scaling options include Optimism and Arbitrum, as well as Polygon.</p>



<ol start="4"><li><strong>Utilize your gas tokens</strong></li></ol>



<p>You may earn ETH as refunds when you erase your storage variables on the Ethereum network. It is the backbone of gas tokens. When the gas costs are cheap, you can mint a large number of gas tokens.</p>



<p>Redeem your gas tokens into ETH when you need to complete a network transaction. Then, use the ETH you&#8217;ve been given to pay for the gas.</p>



<h2>Final words</h2>



<p>Whatever operations are carried out on Ethereum, the scalability issue will continue to exist for many years. Therefore, avoiding excessive Ethereum gas prices is an excellent project to take on at any time.</p>



<p>With the above-mentioned tips, you can always spend lesser Ethereum gas fees when minting your NFTs or transferring tokens as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency adoption has grown by leaps and bounds both at the individual and institutional levels. From being on the fringes of the financial ecosystem once, cryptocurrencies have slowly come to be accepted as a viable investment option. Like stocks, millions of traders <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/top-10-cryptocurrencies-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">invest in cryptocurrencies today</a>. </p>



<p>Since markets keep changing their moods and bears and bulls, attempt to pull the price in their direction time and again, it is best to DYOR before you buy any of the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/top-cryptocurrencies-you-should-buy-and-hold-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">best cryptocurrencies in India</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the crypto market is still reeling under hiked inflation rates and intramural factors, traders can rope in the opportunity to buy cryptocurrencies at a lower price and benefit when prices rise. Below is the list of top six cryptos to buy in India in June 2022: </p>



<p><em>(Percentages and prices as of 14th June 2022)</em></p>



<h2>1. Bitcoin (BTC)</h2>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/BTC-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Bitcoin</a> is the largest cryptocurrency by market cap and dominates almost 45% of the market share. It reached its ATH of $68,000 in November last year but has been on a downslide since then. In June 2022, BTC lost almost 70% of its ATH value and is yet to form a bottom. BTC is currently near its 200-week moving average of $22k, crucial support in its lifetime. </p>



<p>Bitcoin has borne cyclical losses of up to 80% twice and has rebounded to create new highs. Bear markets essentially call out for traders to consider <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-to-buy-bitcoin-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin as the best crypto to buy</a> in June.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>2. Ethereum (ETH)</h2>



<p>The alma mater for all things decentralized, <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/ETH-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Ethereum</a> successfully underwent its Ropsten upgrade and, in two months or so will shift to the Proof of Stake consensus under its Merge upgrade. The Merge will be a historical event for its extent and scale. Ethereum is also down by almost 70% from its November ATH of $4,800 and is currently floating above the $1.2k mark. </p>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-to-buy-ethereum-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum</a> continues to be the most preferred platform for hosting dApps and other Defi platforms. The network continues to gather greater acceptance and should be on your list of which crypto to buy in India today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>3. Cardano (ADA)</h2>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/ADA-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Cardano</a> is a layer-2 scaling solution to Ethereum that uses the Proof-of-Stake consensus to validate transactions. It is one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap and should be your choice of crypto to buy in June. Cardano has lost over 80% of its value in the market crash but awaits its upcoming upgrade &#8211; the Vasil upgrade &#8211; scheduled to happen later this month. </p>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-to-buy-cardano-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">Cardano’s upgrades</a> are followed by massive price spurts, and the speculation and anticipation building around it make it a great choice of crypto to buy in India today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>4. Solana (SOL)</h2>



<p>Another layer-1 scaling solution to Ethereum, <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/SOL-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Solana</a> has recently faced issues such as a series of outages and the infamous wormhole attack. However, despite losing a major chunk of its 2021 ATH, Solana continues to be the top favorite crypto to buy in June among the traders. The investors and the community that backs Solana support it wholeheartedly. </p>



<p>The recent introduction of Chainlink oracles on Solana’s Mainnet has also upped its prospects as viable crypto to buy in India today. <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/solana-coin-investment-tips-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">Solana</a> is currently trading around $30 and is poised for a rebound sooner and later.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>5. Ripple (XRP)</h2>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/XRP-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">XRP</a> was launched by <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-to-buy-ripple-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ripple</a> labs as a cost-effective and fast way to transfer value via its real-time settlement system. Though XRP cannot be called a blockchain in the truest sense, it is one of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap and also the top crypto to buy in India currently. </p>



<p>It has secured partnerships with over 300 financial institutions in 45 countries, and the SEC lawsuit is nearing an end. The extensive utilities it supports and the community support will surely help XRP rise despite the market slump in the near future.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>6. Tron (TRX)</h2>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-tron/" data-wpel-link="internal">Tron</a> is a decentralized operating system that allows users to create dApps using the platform’s smart contracts. While top cryptocurrencies continue to shed gains in the current market slump, Tron is one of the few cryptos that have gathered value since June 2021. </p>



<p>It has over 67 million user accounts and has facilitated 2.6 billion transactions to date. Another top crypto, <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/TRX-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">TRX</a>, remains the go-to crypto to buy in June.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>Trading in cryptocurrencies can be rewarding if done after good research of the market conditions and analyzing the crypto fundamentally and technically. </p>



<p>If you are a trader looking for a cryptocurrency exchange to start your <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-to-open-an-account-on-wazirx/" data-wpel-link="internal">crypto trading journey</a>, head to WazirX and experience the best trading experience in hundreds of cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The crypto market&#8217;s record-breaking meltdown has forced a series of DeFi applications and their communities to rush to safeguard themselves against a wave of liquidations, sometimes by taking extreme steps.</p></blockquote>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/SOL-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Solana</a> is currently in a terrible spot. Several times, the network has come to a standstill, and the price has plummeted. Any additional downward pressure on its price might cause investors more remarkable anguish and losses. Something is coming, though, as a massive liquidation on Solana&#8217;s Solend protocol.</p>



<p>A whale just deposited 5.7 M SOL worth around $170 million and borrowed $108 million USDT and USDC. Due to the possibility of liquidation, Solend on the Solana network advises acquiring the user&#8217;s funds and preventing the liquidation.</p>



<p>Before we move further, let&#8217;s briefly overview what whales are.</p>



<h2>What are whales?</h2>



<p>Whales are the world&#8217;s most giant mammals, and the crypto world is no exception. Individuals or groups holding or hoarding the most bitcoin are called &#8220;crypto whales.&#8221;</p>



<p>They are strong investors. When a person has the capacity to affect the value of a currency by a massive amount, he is referred to as a whale. So when you witness a large and abrupt surge in the value of your currency on the chart, you can be confident that one or more whales are impacting the price.</p>



<p><strong>Importance of crypto whales</strong></p>



<p>Crypto prices are determined mainly by supply and demand. When a significant portion of a coin&#8217;s supply is held out of circulation, the price of the coins that remain in circulation increases.</p>



<p>As a result, the value of a massive quantity of coins will drop if they are unexpectedly liquidated. As a result, whales have a one-of-a-kind potential to influence the crypto market to their benefit.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s look at what crypto liquidation means to grasp better what&#8217;s going on with Solend, the Solana-based <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-problems-can-defi-solve/" data-wpel-link="internal">DeFi</a> lending platform.</p>



<h2>What is crypto liquidation?</h2>



<p>Liquidation is a type of the process of selling crypto assets for cash to reduce losses, particularly in the case of a market meltdown.</p>



<p>However, in the crypto world, the term &#8220;liquidation&#8221; refers to a trader&#8217;s position being forced to close owing to a partial or entire loss of the trader&#8217;s initial margin. This occurs when they are unable to fulfill the margin requirements for their leveraged position – that is, they do not have enough cash to keep the trade open. In addition, when the price of the underlying asset drops suddenly, margin needs are frequently underfunded.</p>



<p>When this occurs, the exchange will liquidate the trade automatically, resulting in a loss of dollars for the investor. The severity of the loss will be determined by the starting margin and the price decline. However, it might result in a total investment loss in rare situations.</p>



<p>After understanding the base of this article, it&#8217;ll be easy to know what&#8217;s happening with Solend.</p>



<h2>What&#8217;s happening at Solend Labs?</h2>



<p>Solend is a decentralized algorithmic lending and borrowing protocol on Solana that allows you to earn interest on deposits and borrow assets.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/WatcherGuru/status/1538589838839992320" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Solend</a>, if the price of Solana (SOL) declines and the whale is liquidated, the lending platform may &#8220;end up with bad debt&#8221; and burden the Solana network. The idea was approved, outraging criticism from the community members.</p>



<p>The Solend team conducted a second governance proposal vote to invalidate the previously-approved plan as the community denounced the move, calling it the polar opposite of what DeFi should be and simply illegal. The recommendation to disregard the &#8220;<a href="https://realms.today/dao/7sf3tcWm58vhtkJMwuw2P3T6UBX7UE5VKxPMnXJUZ1Hn/proposal/HuaL6cDtuNtfnJgvwMnYiZDHVCoLAuDtVFgJD8kYChJ4" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">SLND1</a>: Mitigate Risk From Whale&#8221; proposal received 1,480,264 votes in favor.</p>



<p>The new plan nullifies the prior vote and will compel Solend to come up with a different solution that does not include forcibly taking over an account. It also cuts down the time it takes to vote on governance to one day.</p>



<p>The situation has put the crypto lending platform into a gruesome dilemma. If Solend succeeds at taking over the whale&#8217;s wallet and being granted emergency powers, it may save SOL from a DeFi implosion. However, this will show that anyone&#8217;s assets can be confiscated within the platform and can cause a boycott.</p>



<p>On the other side, others predict that if the Solend team is unable to address the concerns surrounding the whale&#8217;s account, it will cause a Solana meltdown, leading SOL&#8217;s price to plummet.</p>



<h2>Final thoughts</h2>



<p>Solend Labs has created a terrible trend by liquidating whale accounts using &#8220;emergency powers.&#8221; Controlling wallets under the pretext of reducing liquidity concerns is no way to ensure the stability of DeFi systems. Unfortunately, with DeFi, this has become the norm.</p>



<p>In DeFi, the illusion of decentralization is more visible than ever. But unfortunately, decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols have drifted from decentralization&#8217;s founding principles, progressively leaning toward bureaucracy and restriction.</p>

<p>The crypto economy across the world peaked in the post-Covid-19 times, reaching several all-time highs in 2021. However, many <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/top-cryptocurrencies-you-should-buy-and-hold-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">cryptocurrencies</a>, including <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>, have been facing particularly brutal price drops as of mid-2022. Many saw the seemingly reliable stablecoin TerraUSD jump into a death spiral, along with its underlying crypto LUNA. Even Bitcoin, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/historical-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">which hit an all-time high of almost $69,000 back in November of 2021</a>, has plummeted below $30,000 as of the beginning of June 2022. </p>

<p>While the bearish sentiments spreading through the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/why-are-the-crypto-markets-crashing-in-2022/" data-wpel-link="internal">crypto markets</a> may be disheartening, it’s important to remember that it’s in the nature of cryptocurrencies to be highly <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/will-crypto-markets-get-less-volatile/" data-wpel-link="internal">volatile</a>, and this is not the first time Bitcoin (or any other crypto for that matter) is witnessing such fluctuations. Indeed, dramatic gains and losses like this have been seen before, such as the time when Bitcoin reached the high of $20,000 in December 2017, only to plummet to around $3,500 within a year. </p>



<p>For new investors, the current crypto market situation can be scary. But it’s imperative that you keep a level head if you’re here to play the long game. To help you reorient yourself in a shifting market, we bring you a list of seven basic things to do as an investor when the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/why-are-the-crypto-markets-crashing-in-2022/" data-wpel-link="internal">crypto market</a> crashes: </p>



<h1>Seven Things You Can do During a Crypto Market Crash</h1>



<ul><li><strong>Keep Your Cool:</strong> You may decide to sell your <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-cryptocurrency/" data-wpel-link="internal">cryptocurrency</a> once the market starts going down, or you may see the dip as an opportunity to buy more of a crypto. Whatever you do, you first need to keep calm so you can make a decision rationally. </li></ul>



<p>Making decisions solely driven by emotions- especially when the market is volatile- may result in extreme losses. Instead of rushing into the market out of sheer panic and making a rash move, you may want to remember your trading goals and strategies and make a decision based on them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Evaluate the Market Situation:</strong> When the market dips, there may be a different factor behind it driving the change aside from trader emotions or false rumors spread through the internet. For instance, in 2017, China banned crypto exchanges operating in the country, and in 2021 again, China forbade financial organizations from facilitating any crypto-related services. Both these events caused significant drops in crypto prices across the globe.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Very recently, TerraUSD also plummeted- as mentioned before, because a number of investors feared its peg to the dollar wasn’t backed by the required amount of LUNA. Unfortunately, this sentiment rapidly spread to the wider market before the price crashes could be controlled.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Remember that the Crypto Markets are Volatile by Nature:</strong>  Since <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-cryptocurrency/" data-wpel-link="internal">cryptocurrency</a> generates no cash flow, traders rely on changes in market sentiments to propel the prices in the first place. This volatility is actually the biggest factor that draws most traders to crypto, so you must not let ups and downs in prices drive you into a state of panic.  </li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Consider Potential Future Developments: </strong>Most cryptocurrencies are used as stores of value so far instead of a replacement for fiat currency. Some countries like El Salvador, however, <a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/world/el-salvador-becomes-first-country-to-use-bitcoin-as-legal-tender-11631144769412.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">have made crypto legal tender</a>, and countries like the USA are considering how to best regulate their respective crypto markets. </li></ul>



<p>Still, there are also nations like China that have imposed outright bans on crypto or are considering doing so. So it’s important that you take the future of crypto into consideration and re-evaluate your risk appetite when you’re in a tough spot with your investments.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>Determine Your Course of Action: </strong>Once you have assessed the entire situation cool-headedly, you may decide to use the dip as an opportunity to invest more in an asset, or you may decide to exit the market to avoid any further risks. If you’d like to give the whole thing a little more time, you can even try selling some of your positions while keeping the rest of your investment as is.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Make Sure You Have Invested Only What You Can Stand to Lose: </strong>This is one of the fundamentals of investing in crypto: since it’s a pretty risky asset class, only invest funds you can afford to lose. This way, any losses will only be disappointing, and you can wait for the prices to recover again.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Keep an Emergency Fund for Unexpected Disasters: </strong>Another thing that goes without saying: you must make sure to have a solid emergency fund before investing. This way, you can keep your cool and make knowledgeable decisions in times when your investment is at risk.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>So these were seven very basic things you can do to deal with a <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/why-are-the-crypto-markets-crashing-in-2022/" data-wpel-link="internal">crypto market crash</a>. We wish you good luck in your future crypto trades!</p>

<p>As the world progresses towards digitization, the modes of payment keep evolving with each passing year &#8211; from physical modes to digital money and now <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-cryptocurrency/" data-wpel-link="internal">cryptocurrency</a>. Today millions of people own <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/top-cryptocurrencies-you-should-buy-and-hold-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">cryptocurrencies</a>, and reciprocally, thousands of e-commerce merchants and websites have started accepting cryptocurrency as a mode of payment. The first physical <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a> transaction was two pizzas in exchange for 10,000 BTC! While we have come a long way from that era, cryptocurrency payments posit some uncertainties and reservations for customers who are still getting used to digital asset payments. </p>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/top-cryptocurrencies-you-should-buy-and-hold-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">Cryptocurrencies</a> help overcome the limitations faced by traditional payment systems like lack of automation, delayed cross-border transactions, and third-party involvement. Businesses worldwide understand the hitches in the traditional payment systems and seek to embrace crypto payments, allowing more payment options to customers.  </p>



<p>But <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">cryptocurrency</a> payments are a bit more complex than traditional fiat payments, as transferring cryptocurrencies from one wallet to another requires some understanding and know-how of operating wallets and public-private keys and a certain level of caution. To smoothen out these issues, e-commerce merchants and websites use cryptocurrency payment gateways, just like regular payment gateways, enabling digital payments and instantly receiving fiat currency in exchange.  Let’s discuss. </p>



<h2>What is a crypto payment gateway?&nbsp;</h2>



<p><em>Investopedia defines a cryptocurrency payment gateway as ‘a transaction facilitator between merchants and customers for processing payments.’ </em>It is a dynamic payment processing platform that allows organizations and businesses to accept payments in cryptocurrencies without any security hazards.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It supports direct payments from crypto wallets for users. These payment gateways responsibly transfer customers&#8217; payment-related wallet details to the merchant&#8217;s software. With increasing businesses looking for good, instant, and safer payment gateways, crypto payment gateways have become the obvious choice.</p>



<p>Here are the workflow steps involved in a cryptocurrency payment gateway:</p>



<ol><li>The customer chooses to make cryptocurrency payments at checkout &#8211; in-app, in-store, or on the web.&nbsp;</li><li>The customer pays the merchant or website an amount equal to the cryptocurrency’s market value at the transaction time.</li><li>The cryptocurrency payment gateway converts this amount into the currency the e-commerce merchant/firm chooses.&nbsp;</li><li>The money is instantly added to the merchant’s account with the provider and, at regular intervals, is transferred to the designated bank account mentioned in the service contract of the merchant/firm.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<h2>Main features of crypto payment gateways&nbsp;</h2>



<p>As the trend of crypto payment gateways escalates, the number of crypto payment gateways are also increasing. Certain salient features differentiate the best crypto payment gateways from the rest. Given below are some must-have features:</p>



<h3>Peer-to-peer Transactions</h3>



<p>E-commerce vendors, merchants, retailers, and businesses can receive payments directly from the customers over a peer-to-peer system by deploying a decentralized payment gateway into their existing payment module. This feature brings two benefits- speed in transactions and a secure environment over the payment gateway.</p>



<h3>Cross-border transactions<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Usually, a fiat currency transaction takes up to 5 to 15 days, while crypto-based transactions take just a few minutes to complete the process. The fast speed helps businesses for quicker national or international imports and exports via seamless cross-border transactions.</p>



<h3>No intermediaries<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>The crypto payment gateways eliminate the role of third parties in transaction processing. So, the payments directly reach the customer to the merchant at lower transaction costs.</p>



<h3>Compatible with operating systems&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The crypto payment gateways are fully compatible with different operating systems like- Windows, macOS, Linux, etc. Therefore, merchants do not need to configure their device or the application to integrate the payment gateway.</p>



<h3>Easier auto settlement procedure&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Crypto payment gateways offer an auto settlement option through which one can easily connect payment gateway to exchanges to instantly convert cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies or stablecoins.</p>



<h3>Simple integration&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Cryptocurrency payment gateways are simple to integrate into any existing application. Therefore, merchants and vendors can easily plug in a crypto gateway to their application and start accepting payments in crypto.</p>



<h2>Benefits of Crypto Payment Gateways</h2>



<h3>Confidentiality&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Unlike the traditional payment gateways, decentralized crypto payment gateways neither ask for registration or any KYC (Know Your Customer) details for verification purposes. The platform allows users to join the network anonymously. This anonymity feature is essential for merchants to safeguard user privacy.</p>



<h3>No chargebacks&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The system does not allow chargebacks or refunds as the payment gets processed from a crypto payment gateway. This feature allows enterprises with higher-risk businesses to use these payment gateways.</p>



<h3>Instantaneous processing</h3>



<p>Crypto payment processing usually takes less than 10 seconds, and with no intermediary involvement, the processing is really fast and allows merchants and vendors to accept crypto payments easily and quickly. Crypto payment gateways also allow users to exchange crypto for fiat money quickly.</p>



<h2>Disadvantages of Crypto payment gateways&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Despite all their advantages, these payment gateways are essentially third-party players. <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/top-cryptocurrencies-you-should-buy-and-hold-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">Cryptocurrencies</a> were originally designed to bypass these middlemen, and using them defeats the very purpose of cryptocurrencies. Being third-party gateways, the performance of these crypto payment gateways is dependent on the provider’s ability to allow uninterrupted services from across the globe. Crypto payment gateways add an additional layer to the fee structure beyond wallet fees.  If ever a payment gateway is hacked, the merchant may lose all their funds. </p>



<p>It should be said here that cryptocurrency payment gateways aren’t necessary, and it is perfectly fine if you want to use your personal crypto-wallet to accept crypto payments. These crypto payment gateways reduce the extra steps of exchanging cryptocurrencies and manage your wallet on your behalf.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are plenty of such crypto payment gateways, such as Coingate, BitPay, Shopify Gateway, SpicePay, etc., which, when picked with proper knowledge, can help users in multiple ways possible.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies are still in their nascence, and the inherent volatility in the market demands rapt attention for the traders to profit from the price fluctuations. If the price dips too low, you may lose a considerable portion of your crypto investments.</p>



<p>If you are experienced with <a href="https://wazirx.com/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">cryptocurrency trading</a>, you probably already know that different order types can affect your trades in different ways and can seriously help increase your return on investment (ROI). </p>



<p>One such way is using limit order in crypto, which can help you have greater command over your <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-cryptocurrency/" data-wpel-link="internal">cryptocurrency</a> trades. So let’s understand the concept of a limit order in crypto and how to buy a limit order in crypto so that when we trade, we play our cards right.  </p>



<h2>What is a Limit Order?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>A limit order allows traders to set a limit price to buy and sell <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/top-cryptocurrencies-you-should-buy-and-hold-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">cryptocurrencies</a> in the market. The limit order mechanism works quite straightforwardly &#8211;  if the market price of your crypto or other digital asset investment reaches the limit price, your order is executed; if not, the order doesn’t execute itself. Hence, a limit order allows you to buy or sell cryptocurrencies at a limit price or a better price.  </p>



<ul><li>Buy Limit Order: The order gets executed at the limit price or a lower price. For example, A trader wants to buy Bitcoin. They set the buy limit order at INR 30 lakhs. The order gets executed as soon as the price touches INR 30 lakhs or dips lower.&nbsp;</li><li>Sell Limit Order: The order gets executed at the limit price or a higher price. For example, the same trader wants to sell Ethereum. They set the limit order at INR 2 lakhs. The order gets executed as soon as the price reaches the limit price or climbs higher up.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Stipulating and setting limit orders allows traders to manage their trade prices better. However, while an investor gets the guarantee that he will buy or sell at the limit price or a better price, the order fulfillment isn’t a guarantee. Unless the cryptocurrency’s price meets the order qualifications, the order isn’t executed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investors usually use limit orders when:</p>



<ul><li>They are worried that a cryptocurrency&#8217;s price is too volatile.</li><li>&nbsp;When they are not much invested in executing a trade at the moment.&nbsp;</li><li>When the investors consider the total price paid more significant than the trade execution speed.&nbsp;</li><li>Some investors use limit orders solely based on the belief that an asset&#8217;s price will reach a more desirable level.</li></ul>



<p>Limit orders are great for patient investors and those who want to hodl by purchasing <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/top-cryptocurrencies-you-should-buy-and-hold-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">cryptocurrencies</a> at low prices. But, there is a risk of missing out if the market turns around. If an order is not fulfilled, an investor might miss out on a good trading opportunity.</p>



<h2>How Do Limit Orders Work?</h2>



<p>A limit order can be used at various times. For example, when a stock is increasing or going down very quickly or when the trader is fearful of the market volatility. A limit order lets traders exercise more control over the execution price, especially if they are apprehensive of using a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketorder.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">market order</a> during periods of heightened <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">volatility</a>. Moreover, a limit order can be very useful when a trader cannot watch a stock at all times but has a particular price in mind to buy or sell that cryptocurrency asset. </p>



<p>Another thing for investors to consider while placing a limit order is the order&#8217;s expiration date. Generally, limit orders used in <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-cryptocurrency/" data-wpel-link="internal">cryptocurrency</a> trades last for 24 hours. Unless you watch the market closely, you might end up buying or selling at a less desirable price because a faulty assessment of the price movement in the market will subsequently lead to the investor undervaluing the limit order. Investors and traders should review their open limit orders from time to time to keep up with the ever-changing market conditions.</p>



<h2>Why Use Limit order?</h2>



<p>The most beneficial aspect of a limit order is that the trader can execute a trade at a price that is right for them. The trader gets to predetermine the rate at which they want to trade. Additional benefits of a limit order include:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>One can specify the amount even when the crypto has not yet hit the mark.</li><li>It is beneficial when one is trading larger volumes.&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;If a trader believes that a cryptocurrency is currently undervalued, they can buy the stock and set a limit order to sell once the price goes up. In contrast, traders who believe a stock is overpriced can place a limit order to buy shares once that price falls.</li><li>As limit orders are automated, investors don&#8217;t have to watch the market 24/7 or worry about missing a buy or sell opportunity while they sleep.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h3>What is a stop-limit order?&nbsp;</h3>



<p>A stop-limit order is a combination of a limit order and a stop trigger. When a trader sets a stop-limit order, a limit order automatically gets placed once the trigger price is achieved, whether you are online or not. This arrangement allows traders to set the minimum amount of profit they can make and the maximum amount of loss they can bear. Traders can base their stop-limit order on resistance and support levels and the associated volatility of the asset.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>How to buy a Limit Order on Wazirx?</h2>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/BTC-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">WazirX</a> is one of India&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, which supports more than three hundred different crypto assets, thus giving users a plethora of options to pick and trade!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s say you want to buy an XYZ crypto at a lower price than the current trading price. You can place a buy limit order and specify a maximum price you&#8217;re willing to pay.</p>



<ol><li>Log in to your Wazirx account.</li><li>Deposit funds into your WazirX account. If you already have funds in your WazirX wallet, skip this step.&nbsp;</li><li>Select stop limit from the app&#8217;s dropdown menu in the Buy/Sell section.</li><li>Enter your desired stop price.</li><li>Enter your limit price.</li><li>Enter your desired amount at which you want to buy your crypto. You can also use the % buttons to fill the amount automatically.</li><li>Click on the Place Order button.</li></ol>



<p>Limit orders can be an ideal way to prevent missing an investment opportunity. You may use it to maximize unrealized gains or limit the potential for loss. That&#8217;s especially true if you&#8217;re concerned (and any investor would be) about getting hammered by wild swings in the prices of <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/top-cryptocurrencies-you-should-buy-and-hold-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">cryptocurrencies</a>. However, if you&#8217;re concerned that you&#8217;re buying too high or selling too low, you might want to do your own research or consult an expert.</p>

<p>A decentralized exchange (DEX) is one of the fascinating developments of the DeFi revolution. As you may already know, DeFi is a movement in which developers construct decentralized alternatives to many traditional legacy financial institutions and goods. The decentralized version of exchange, such as a crypto exchange, is commonly known as DEX.</p>



<p>Before we answer the &#8220;How DEXs came to the rescue of CEXs shortcomings?&#8221; question, let&#8217;s learn about centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges, and points of differences between them.</p>



<h2>What are centralized exchanges (CEX)?</h2>



<p>Centralized exchanges (CEX) are platforms that allow users to purchase and sell cryptocurrencies for fiat currencies such as the US dollar or between digital assets such as BTC and ETH. They operate as reliable intermediaries in trades and frequently serve as custodians, keeping and safeguarding your assets.</p>



<p>While they have certain flaws, they have some advantages, as well:</p>



<ul><li>They have a high level of liquidity on a continual basis.</li><li>They are responsible for the great majority of trade activity.</li><li>Typically, centralized exchanges are much faster, resulting in a better user experience.</li></ul>



<p>Before we move further into comprehending how DEXs is the rescuer, let&#8217;s understand what the components that make an exchange are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Graphical user interface (GUI):</strong> This customer-facing interface comprises everything you see as a user on the website.</li><li><strong>Trading engine:</strong> A trading engine, also known as a matching engine, is a piece of software that keeps track of all open orders and creates transactions when two of them match.</li><li><strong>Cryptocurrency wallets:</strong> When you register with the exchange, you will be given wallets for specific cryptos.</li><li><strong>Liquidity:</strong> Exchanges must have enough liquidity to maintain a healthy trading environment.</li></ul>



<h2>What are decentralized exchanges (DEX)?</h2>



<p>A decentralized exchange (DEX) is a peer-to-peer marketplace where cryptocurrency traders may deal directly with one another. DEXs provide one of crypto&#8217;s most fundamental functions: facilitating financial transactions that aren&#8217;t mediated by banks, brokers, payment processors, or any other third party.</p>



<p>Some of the most popular DEXs are based on the Ethereum blockchain. They are part of a growing suite of <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-defi/" data-wpel-link="internal">decentralized finance (DeFi)</a> technologies that allow users to access a wide range of financial services straight from a compatible crypto wallet.</p>



<h2>How does decentralized exchange work?</h2>



<p>Decentralized exchange (DEX) is simply a set of smart contracts.</p>



<p>(Note: <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-are-smart-contracts-and-why-you-need-to-know-about-them/" data-wpel-link="internal">Smart contracts</a> are self-executing, automated agreements between two directly linked parties.)</p>



<p>DEX uses &#8220;liquidity pools,&#8221; in which investors lock cash in exchange for interest-like returns, to ease transactions and set the values of multiple cryptocurrencies against each other algorithmically.</p>



<p>DEX transactions are processed immediately on the blockchain, unlike centralized exchange transactions, which are registered on the exchange&#8217;s internal database.</p>



<h2>Why choose DEX over CEX?</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Custody of Assets</strong></li></ul>



<p>Before starting your trade on a centralized exchange, you must first deposit your assets in the exchange&#8217;s custody. On a decentralized exchange, you can keep your assets and have complete control over them.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Impermanent Loss</strong></li></ul>



<p>With the addition of liquidity pools, decentralized exchanges offer a convenient method for crypto trading. Along with the completion of trades, the percentage of different crypto assets in the liquidity pool of DEXs fluctuates constantly. Consequently, the liquidity pool can respond to the changing market conditions by adding additional tokens that are losing value.</p>



<p>Eventually, liquidity providers must remove more tokens, which could lose value. However, in centralized exchanges, you would not find the possibility for impermanent loss.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Availability</strong></li></ul>



<p>Centralized organizations use centralized exchanges and are more vulnerable to system failures. Centralized exchanges, for example, might limit user access to limit losses in the case of catastrophic market collapses. Decentralized exchanges, on the other hand, have no difficulties because there are no intermediaries. Regardless of market collapses, you can always access DEXs and use your assets as you see fit.</p>



<p>To summarize, decentralized exchanges still have a long way to go. However, it has clearly been a more convenient alternative to centralized exchanges. For example, no <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-to-complete-kyc-verification-on-wazirx/" data-wpel-link="internal">KYC verification</a> is required, nor is there any compulsion to surrender custody of your crypto assets to the exchange. As a result, decentralized exchanges, we think, have the ability to reshape the future of cryptocurrency ownership and trade.</p>



<h2>Bottom line</h2>



<p>Determining which form of exchange to use comes down to two factors: A CEX is an ideal option for you if you are primarily concerned with the convenience of use and are hesitant to have complete control over your wallet. And, if you want to save money on fees and have greater control over your money, a DEX is the best option to go.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies are slowly establishing themselves as an alternative payment mode, with more and more companies and global giants beginning to accept cryptocurrencies as payments. For companies, too, being early adopters can help them stay ahead in the race. Many of these organizations are breaking the status quo and using crypto adoption as a marketing gimmick, given that digital payments are becoming the norm and plastic money is being used less and less each day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cryptocurrencies are stored in online or offline wallets and don’t require any third parties like a bank or a financial institution to initiate and validate their transactions. All the transactions concerning cryptocurrencies happen over a blockchain in an immutable, decentralized, and transparent fashion. Many third-world countries have been the biggest adopter of cryptocurrencies as they don’t require any financial infrastructure. Only a mobile phone and internet connection are enough to keep your finances moving.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While governments, like those of El Salvador and the Central African Republic, have already declared Bitcoin as legal tender, a long list of countries have adopted a progressive outlook. Financial Institutions and top global firms like JP Morgan, Barclays, Microstrategy, Block, etc., hold large chunks of their holdings in cryptocurrencies. In addition, world’s top moguls like Tesla, SpaceX, Microsoft, Twitter, PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, Starbucks, etc., all accept cryptocurrency payments.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Global giants accepting cryptos as a payment option</h2>



<p>Cryptocurrencies facilitate borderless payments and are censorship-resistant and almost instantaneous. Since they aren’t governed by any government or institution, anyone from anywhere globally, including India, can purchase goods and services from companies that accept cryptocurrencies as payments.</p>



<p>While there are thousands of companies that accept cryptocurrencies today, let’s discuss a selected few:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li><strong>Microsoft: </strong>Microsoft has been accepting Bitcoin in its online Xbox store since 2014. They momentarily stopped accepting it due to the volatility, but they are now accepting it solely for Xbox store credits.</li></ol>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Overstock: </strong>Overstock now accepts bitcoin as a payment method resulting from a partnership with Coinbase, a global crypto trading platform. The company has developed a system that interacts with the blockchain while also offering additional benefits to individuals who only use its network.</li></ol>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Home Depot: </strong>Home Depot allows Bitcoin payments through Flexa&#8217;s in-store checkout systems. This makes utilizing Bitcoin for payment extremely simple, as Gemini&#8217;s collaboration with Flexa has eliminated all of the friction often associated with Bitcoin transactions.</li></ol>



<ol start="4"><li><strong>Whole Foods: </strong>The Winklevoss Flexa spending app &#8216;Spedn&#8217; has teamed with Whole Foods, and one can easily purchase all of their groceries using Bitcoin, Litecoin, or the Gemini dollar.</li></ol>



<ol start="5"><li><strong>NewEgg: </strong>Newegg is well-known for purchasing cryptocurrency mining hardware in the cryptocurrency world. They supply a wide range of computer gear at various price points. NewEgg began accepting payments in Bitcoin for their hardware after realizing its popularity in the cryptocurrency community.</li></ol>



<ol start="6"><li><strong>AT&amp;T: </strong>AT&amp;T made history by being the first mobile carrier to accept Bitcoin payments in 2019. It uses BitPay, a third-party payment processor, to facilitate transactions. Customers who pay with Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies can choose BitPay as their payment method.</li></ol>



<h2>Companies accepting crypto payments in India</h2>



<p>The 2021 Chainalysis report marked India as the home to the world&#8217;s second-largest number of cryptocurrency holders. While regulatory uncertainties and the new crypto tax regime continue to dampen prospects for cryptocurrencies in India, there are quite a few companies that have started accepting cryptocurrencies as payments, either directly or via payment gateways, to tap their growing user base:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li><strong>HighKart: </strong>The e-commerce store is becoming India&#8217;s leading online store that accepts Bitcoin as payment. The e-commerce portal was launched in 2013. HIghKart customers can purchase mobile phones, cameras, apparel, gadgets, laptops, and crypto mining equipment via Bitcoin.</li></ol>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>The Rug Republic: </strong>The Rug Republic is a Delhi-based decor company that accepts the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap for purchasing its merchandise. The Rug Republic uses the WazirX and Binance platforms for peer-to-peer transactions. However, it wants to develop its own in-house payment system.</li></ol>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Purse: </strong>Purse is an online retailer of electronic devices that accepts cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Customers who have BTC or BCH in their wallet and want to buy any electronic can make purchases directly without converting their crypto holdings into fiat currency. Customers can also convert their bitcoin holdings into gift cards and use them to make purchases on Amazon.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<ol start="4"><li><strong>Sapna: </strong>Sapna is also one of India&#8217;s most popular online retailers, specializing in books, electronics, gifts, health care products, and children&#8217;s toys, among other things. When a customer chooses to pay with crypto tokens, the transaction is completed in under 30 seconds.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>Several other small businesses in India are showing their trust in cryptocurrencies as payment, but the bigger market players are still waiting for regulatory clarity before they finally enter the crypto waters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>India is at a very nascent stage regarding regulations and initiatives toward greater crypto adoption. Whether cryptocurrencies will become an alternative medium of exchange would depend on the upcoming cryptocurrency bill still waiting to go on the floors of parliament.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How does buying real estate with cryptocurrency sound now that the metaverse concept is gripping the world? Read this blog to learn more about this idea.</p>



<p>When it comes to value appreciation, real estate has long been viewed among the most popular investment possibilities. After all, it&#8217;s a finite amount, and its usefulness is rooted in its status as a limited resource. But what happens if real estate starts to lose its realism?</p>



<p>When you enter the realm of virtual real estate, you&#8217;ll find a lively housing market that&#8217;s exactly like the one you&#8217;ll find in everyday life. Everything from estate brokers to rental agreements to land barons may be found. Except it&#8217;s all in <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/metaverse-vs-virtual-reality/" data-wpel-link="internal">virtual reality</a>, a far-fetched notion a few decades ago but is now a developing reality.</p>



<h2>Introduction to Metaverse real estate</h2>



<p>Land parcels in virtual worlds are known as metaverse real estate. They are pixels in the most basic sense. They&#8217;re more than simply digital photos, though. They&#8217;re programmable areas on virtual reality platforms where users may interact, play games, sell NFTs, attend meetings, attend virtual concerts, and engage in various other virtual activities.</p>



<p>Digital real estate is predicted to flourish and expand in tandem with the advent of the Metaverse. In fact, once Facebook rebranded to META and expressed a strong interest in the Metaverse in the fourth quarter of 2021, there was a metaverse real estate bubble. From 2022 to 2028, the value of metaverse real estate is expected to expand at a CAGR of 31.2 percent as its popularity grows.</p>



<p>Reasons to invest in Metaverse real estate include:</p>



<ul><li>It allows individuals to connect with other people online.</li><li>People can play games and interact on their digital land.</li><li>Creators can charge for access to their material or trade their NFTs to monetize it.</li><li>Brands may leverage their virtual assets to promote services, introduce virtual products, and deliver unique consumer experiences.</li></ul>



<h2>Is buying a Metaverse property similar to purchasing an NFT?</h2>



<p>Purchasing a metaverse property is quite similar to buying <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-nft-minting/" data-wpel-link="internal">an NFT</a>. However, on a blockchain, your deed of ownership is a one-of-a-kind piece of code. This code verifies your ownership or rights to that digital plot of land.</p>



<p>So you&#8217;ll have to have your digital crypto wallet to start your metaverse real estate portfolio. Before signing up for a new wallet, you should check out the platforms that employ various cryptocurrencies for their transactions. After that, go to the virtual metaverse platform and register for an account. Next, you&#8217;ll need to link your digital wallet to the site to acquire land and other assets. Finally, choose a piece of property and buy it.</p>



<p>Metaverse land may be purchased through brokers and property managers, just as real-world properties. However, unlike in the real world, metaverse brokers do not require licenses and are not subject to any restrictions. As a result, be sure you&#8217;re dealing with reputable companies.</p>



<h2>List of things to do with your virtual real estate</h2>



<p>Land in the Metaverse provides a possibility for users to monetize virtual assets and events that occur there. Some of the revenue-generating trends that are now in play range from renting to managing metaverse land:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Flipping Land</strong></li></ul>



<p>Users may buy a parcel of virtual land and then resell it for a profit.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Building infrastructures</strong></li></ul>



<p>Rather than allowing a plot of land remains idle, many users are choosing to construct a variety of virtual properties on it, either for themselves or for other users to utilize. This comprises digital casinos, nightclubs, performance venues, NFT galleries, and retail outlets, among other things.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Brokering</strong></li></ul>



<p>Because of the popularity of land NFTs, professional real estate brokers have emerged who, much like in real life, connect sellers with potential purchasers or advise customers on how to manage their metaverse properties effectively.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Advertising</strong></li></ul>



<p>Areas of the Metaverse with a lot of foot activity are becoming more and more useful for advertising. Owners of that land can rent it out and allow businesses to advertise their goods and services there.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Events and services</strong></li></ul>



<p>The Metaverse is meant to enhance the online experiences we already enjoy while allowing us to create new ones. As a result, metaverse land is being used to host events and provide services.</p>



<h2>How to choose the best parcel of land to buy on the Metaverse?</h2>



<p>Location is essential when choosing a virtual land in the<a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/best-metaverse-coins-to-invest-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal"> Metaverse</a>, just as it is in the real world.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re looking to invest in metaverse real estate, search for places with growth potential. Places, where people can assemble will be more valued than those in unremarkable neighborhoods. Also, consider property holdings close to developed areas but not within them. You may get these properties at a lesser price, develop them, and then wait for the market to rise.</p>



<h2>Final thoughts: Is buying virtual real estate in Metaverse a good investment?</h2>



<p>Any investment you could consider making, like any other burgeoning technology, comes with risks and benefits. While the notion of metaverse land (and its absence of tangible assets) may be perplexing to some, the promise of virtual worlds, related technologies such as virtual and augmented reality, and artificial intelligence cannot be denied. Only time will tell if the Metaverse is another speculative investment full of expensive digital assets or whether virtual worlds are the internet&#8217;s future.</p>

<p>As cryptocurrencies continue to disrupt traditional financial markets, they have also opened up new investment avenues for the average investor. While the buy-and-hold technique is one of the most popular crypto strategies for generating higher yields, staking is rapidly becoming a viable alternative.</p>



<p>Sure, the crypto market is as lucrative as it is risky, but unlike the stock market, it operates 24/7, and not everyone has the time or resources to monitor the market constantly and fine-tune their investment strategies.&nbsp; This is where crypto staking comes in. Staking allows investors to earn passive income on their crypto assets without being consumed entirely by the volatility of the crypto market. Here’s everything you need to know.</p>



<h2>Crypto staking: An overview</h2>



<p>In its most basic form, staking is the crypto equivalent of putting money in a high-yield savings account. When you put money in a savings account, the bank usually takes it and lends it to others, and you get a percentage of the interest collected in exchange for keeping your money with the bank.</p>



<p>Likewise, you lock up your money to participate in the blockchain&#8217;s operation and security when you stake your digital assets. In exchange, you will receive incentives based on percentage yields. These profits are generally significantly higher than any bank&#8217;s interest rate.</p>



<p>Staking also improves the security and efficiency of the blockchain projects you support. By staking your funds, you essentially increase the blockchain&#8217;s capacity to endure attacks and execute transactions. Generally, staking-enabled cryptocurrencies use a &#8220;consensus mechanism&#8221; called Proof of Stake (PoS) to ensure that all transactions are validated and secured without the involvement of a bank or payment processor.</p>



<h2>Getting started with crypto staking: Top 4 platforms</h2>



<p>Crypto staking is no hurdle; it is open to anyone interested in participating. While becoming a full validator can require a substantial minimum investment, technical knowledge, sophisticated hardware, as well as major security considerations, a dedicated staking platform where you can contribute any amount you can afford to a staking pool is one of the easiest ways to get started with crypto staking. This not only lowers entry barriers but also enables investors to begin earning rewards without the hassles of owning and controlling any equipment.</p>



<p>Here are the top 4 crypto staking platforms for you to check out.</p>



<h2>#1 &#8211;&nbsp; AQRU</h2>



<p>AQRU is an easy-to-use app that allows users to purchase, invest in, and receive income on their crypto assets. Users can deposit their assets on the site with just a few clicks via crypto, bank transfer, or credit card payment, and deposits come at no extra cost.&nbsp; Yields range from 1% for BTC and ETH to 15% for EUR and USD-denominated assets. And the best part is,&nbsp; unlike most crypto staking platforms, which require users to deposit their funds for a set amount of time, AQRU has no lock-in period.</p>



<h2>#2 &#8211; BlockFi</h2>



<p>BlockFi, founded in 2017 by Zac Prince and Flori Marquez, distinguishes itself from other cryptocurrency service providers by combining low charges with institutional-quality features. With BlockFi Interest Accounts (BIA), users may earn attractive returns on their crypto deposits. Starting the day after depositing, assets locked in BIA will accrue monthly compounding crypto staking rewards, delivered to account holders at the end of each month. Moreover, the BlockFi Wallet facilitates all deposits and reward accumulation.</p>



<h2>#3 &#8211; Crypto.com</h2>



<p>Crypto.com allows users to earn up to 14.5% APY on their crypto, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Lumen (XLM), and other compatible coins. The platform supports over 40 cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, allowing investors to choose from a wide range of products. With intuitive navigation and simple tools, Crypto.com&#8217;s user-friendly mobile application makes staking effortless for inexperienced users. Staking rewards are calculated daily and distributed on the platform every seven days.</p>



<h2>#4 &#8211; Binance</h2>



<p>Binance Exchange is one of the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchanges by trade volume. Staking on Binance can be as simple as simply holding your coins on the platforms. There are no fees, and users may take advantage of all the additional perks of holding their cryptocurrencies on Binance. All users need to do is keep their PoS coins on Binance, and all technical requirements will be handled for them. Staking awards are typically given out at the beginning of each month.</p>



<p>Get started with crypto staking today and start earning massive rewards.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The Cool Cats NFT collection was among the most popular in October 2022. The average cost of a single cartoon cat avatar was $92,000 back then.</p></blockquote>



<h2>Introduction to Cool cats</h2>



<p>Cool Cats are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) representing 9,999 hand-drawn cats, each with a unique set of features produced by an algorithm. To learn about the pros and cons of an NFT art, click <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/the-pros-and-cons-of-nft-art/" data-wpel-link="internal">here</a>.</p>



<p>Each cat in the series has its own set of characteristics, a mix of the hundreds of various attributes available in the collection. Different body forms, facial expressions, clothing, accessories, and trait pairings assist in assuring that no two cats in the collection are alike.</p>



<p>The initial success of the Cool Cats NFTs sparked a flurry of community participation and trading activity. As a result, the Cool Cats team hopes to include various additional features in future collection editions.</p>



<p>NFT breeding (similar to CryptoKitties) is intended to be included in the second generation of Cool Cats, allowing users to generate new NFTs depending on the inherited traits of parent NFTs.</p>



<p>The first generation of Cool Cats is constrained to the 9,999 cats that were first launched; each assembled at random from over 300,000 selected features: a unique body, face, hat, and attire.</p>



<p>Cool Cat holders get the following benefits:</p>



<ol><li>The chance to join the Cool Cat community</li><li>Random airdrops&nbsp;</li><li>Easy availability to future Cool Cat events</li><li>Non-exclusive permission to do whatever they want with their Cool Cat NFTs.</li></ol>



<p>A &#8220;coolness&#8221; measure is also used in the Cool Cats project. The majority of Cool Cats are worth 3–6 points:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Cool:</strong> 4,599 cats have a score of 3 to 4 points.</li><li><strong>Wild:</strong> 3,000 cats have a score of 5 to 6 points</li><li><strong>Classy:</strong> 1,750 cats have a score of 7 to 8 points&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Exotic:</strong> 650 cats have a score of 9 to 10 points&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>There are 66 &#8220;super rare&#8221; cats, each of which is one-of-a-kind. The rest of the Cool Cats are dressed in blue and wear various costumes such as knight helmets, TV heads, chef hats, etc. The rarest, or coolest, cats are those with entire clothes. A Cool Cat dressed in a completely assembled pirate costume, for example, is deemed cooler than one dressed in a pirate body and a beanie head.</p>



<h2>Creators of Cool Cat</h2>



<p>The Cool Cats are a four-person team. Tom Williamson, a blockchain and smart contract specialist, is one of them. The website developer and manager is Rob Mehew (Lynqoid). The creative director is Evan Luza (ELU). Finally, Colin Egan (clon), also known as The Cartoonist, is the illustrator.</p>



<p>All Cool Cats are based on the character &#8220;Blue Cat,&#8221; which Egan used to sketch in high school. Colin &#8220;spent years honing the line weight, ear height, and whisker length of Blue Cat to ultimately bring him to his unquestionably amazing and charming final shape,&#8221; according to the Cool Cats blog on Medium.</p>



<p>Cool Cats PFPs was created on July 1, 2021, by a group of self-described &#8220;nerds who are enthusiastic about crypto, art, and making cool stuff.&#8221;</p>



<h2>Can you breed a Cool Cat?</h2>



<p>There isn&#8217;t much information regarding breeding Cool Cats online; however, it appears this feature will be accessible soon in 2022.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;ve been a part of the NFT and digital collectibles scene for a long, you&#8217;re probably aware of the notion of digital breeding cats, as <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-cryptokitties/" data-wpel-link="internal">CryptoKitties</a> was the first to do so in 2017.</p>



<p>A popular theory about breeding is that if a person possesses two or more Cool Cats, they can combine them to create a Second Generation Cool Cat with shared features from the parents.</p>



<h2>What makes Cool Cats cool?</h2>



<p>The team hopes to capitalize on the brand&#8217;s popularity by introducing new game concepts and features into Cool Cats NFTs. For example, Cool Cats established the Adventurer&#8217;s Guild in the first quarter of 2022. In addition, by completing tasks with their Cool Cats NFTs, collectors may earn MILK, the project&#8217;s native social coin. MILK is a cryptocurrency token based on the ERC-20 standard that may be traded for various rewards.</p>



<p>In February 2022, another 19,999 NFTs were manufactured under the name Cool Pets. In addition, the Cool Cats team plans more gaming elements and methods for collectors to connect with their NFT companions.</p>



<p>Cool Cats NFTs&#8217; aesthetic minimalism contrasts with the hyper-detailed images of specific other collections. The Cool Cats collection is presented straightforwardly, evoking Saturday morning cartoons. The collection&#8217;s success may derive from its nostalgic simplicity with only a cartoonish head and shoulders.</p>



<h2>Bottom line</h2>



<p>Since the Egyptian days, humans have been captivated by cats, and it appears that this human tendency hasn&#8217;t altered much in the blockchain age.</p>



<p>Like all other NFT initiatives, the Cool Cats NFT project&#8217;s power and momentum are borne by its strong and active community, which can be found on various social media platforms like the Cool Cat Discord or crypto-related Twitter.</p>

<p>Thanks to the internet and social media, like-minded people can now engage more efficiently than ever before, regardless of their geographical location. In addition, a new type of social network has emerged as a result of the introduction of digitally native money and banking, allowing like-minded individuals to not only socialize but also coordinate around the capital. These new networks, like their predecessors, are unconstrained by geographic borders, allowing them to expand on a wide scale or within a small number of select individuals.</p>



<p>According to the most optimistic thinking, <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/all-you-need-to-know-about-daos/" data-wpel-link="internal">Decentralized Autonomous Organizations</a> (DAO) can transform how people organize and eventually surpass the scale and scope of the world&#8217;s most significant corporations and even nation-states.</p>



<h2>Understanding DAO</h2>



<p>DAOs are software-enabled organizations, to put it simply. They enable individuals to pool resources to pursue a shared objective and share in the value created once those goals are met.</p>



<p>DAOs can be the preferred organizational primitive for Web3 in the same way that the LLC (limited liability corporation) was for the industrial revolution. However, whereas companies are based on the historical financial system and managed through legal contracts, DAOs are organized by tokens with their rules recorded in smart contracts and run on open blockchain networks like Ethereum.</p>



<p>To understand Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) better, let&#8217;s try breaking the terms individually:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Decentralized:</strong> refers to the technology on which these autonomous organizations are constructed and is further defined in this article as Ethereum smart contracts. Organizations founded on legal documents recognized by a central authority, such as the government, maybe the polar opposite of this.</li><li><strong>Autonomous:</strong> in this context, it refers to the ability to continue without outside help. Similar to a self-governing &#8220;autonomous&#8221; zone within a country (like Hong Kong).</li><li><strong>Organization:</strong> This component is well-known, and it may be readily referred to as a group of humans and, if desired, other organizations.</li></ul>



<h2>How does a DAO function?</h2>



<p>Smart contracts are used to create the DAO&#8217;s rules, which are set by a core team of community members. These smart contracts set the groundwork for the DAO&#8217;s operations. They are apparent, verifiable, and publicly auditable, allowing any potential member to comprehend how the protocol will operate at all times fully.</p>



<p>The next stage is for the DAO to learn how to acquire financing and impart governance once these rules have been legally inscribed onto the blockchain.</p>



<p>This is mainly accomplished by token issuance, in which the protocol sells tokens to raise cash and replenish the DAO&#8217;s treasury.</p>



<p>Token holders get their voting rights in exchange for their money, which is generally proportionate to their holdings. As a result, the DAO is ready for deployment once financing is finished.</p>



<h2>Benefits and future of DAO</h2>



<p>DAOs, according to a growing number of <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/2022-ethereum-outlook/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum</a> proponents, can be the future of labor, human organizations, and cultural communities. As a result, some believe that DAOs like DeFi and NFTs will achieve widespread adoption before them.</p>



<p>DAOs will take the place of CEO decisions, border meetings, and ordinary business operations, reducing the amount of time spent on pointless tasks. Furthermore, tokens can be used by shareholders to vote.</p>



<p>DAOs may also use tokenomics to alter the recruiting process, pay decisions, and the employment of engineers.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s look at some of the benefits offered by DAOs to understand their future potential better.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Trustless and secure:</strong> DAOs provide security and are decentralized. If a developer cannot continue working on the project, the system will continue to function, and a new developer will be appointed via a voting mechanism.</li><li><strong>Continuous functionality:</strong> Another advantage of DAOs is that their functions cannot be turned off. No government or financial institution may terminate a DAO unless it has substantial tokens to vote on. Even yet, reaching an agreement on such a proposal will be difficult for the authorizers.</li><li><strong>Open-source ecosystems: </strong>Finally, DAOs are open-source ecosystems, meaning anybody may improve the code. Typically, open-source systems are more dependable since programmers may aid developers in locating code issues and recommending appropriate fixes.</li></ul>



<p>Let&#8217;s see, is DAO a real game-changer for social media?</p>



<h2>How does DAO impact social media?</h2>



<ul><li><strong>DAOs are social by nature.</strong></li></ul>



<p>A social network is created when a DAO is created. A DAO is a collection of people that have banded together to achieve a common objective. They require communication and governance technologies to function and collaborate efficiently. DAOs naturally combine all members&#8217; contributions, create a shared social network, and allow social data to be monetized on-chain in a transparent manner.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Bridge to Web3 for social media firms.</strong></li></ul>



<p>Each social media platform has a stranglehold on a vast amount of user data. As a result, authorities, and consumers are becoming critical of this system. Using blockchain technology to ensure data accountability, openness, and ownership can help to alleviate these issues.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Power of tokens for content providers.</strong></li></ul>



<p>Today&#8217;s social media is centered on user-generated content and the creator economy. However, the platforms that host such activity collect most of the revenue it generates. <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-google-doing-with-blockchain/" data-wpel-link="internal">Blockchain</a> tokens have the potential to change this by allowing creators to monetize their following using many of the same methods that DAOs use to reward members for efforts.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Early adopters as investors</strong></li></ul>



<p>Every new network has the challenge of attracting the initial users and generating enough activity to attract more clients. One barrier to entry that stops new techniques from gaining traction is the network effects exerted by current social media behemoths. DAOs can help networks get off the ground by providing financial incentives to early users.</p>



<h2>Bottom line</h2>



<p>DAOs are still in their infancy, yet they have already accomplished so much, and their potential to be a genuine force for social good is infinite. Moreover, the intrinsic character of DAOs as open, decentralized, community-based organizations lends nicely to the social impact sector, where grassroots and community-level decision-making are valued more than traditional hierarchical structures of charities and non-profits.</p>



<p>In the not-too-distant future, DAOs will be a game-changer for social media. All you need to do now is sit back and watch it develop.</p>

<p>Right now, Celsius is trending on crypto Twitter. There is a lot of speculation going around. Investors and depositors have concerns. A lot is going on. Was a <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/defi-vs-cefi-what-is-the-difference/" data-wpel-link="internal">CeFi</a> lender created on top of quicksand, ostensibly on a robust and US-regulated foundation?</p>



<p>In this article, let&#8217;s find out what&#8217;s going on with Celsius.</p>



<h2>A quick introduction to Celsius Network</h2>



<p>The Celsius Network is a blockchain-based financial technology (fintech) network that provides interest-bearing savings accounts, borrowing, and payments using digital and fiat currencies. It runs on an economic basis that defies traditional banking paradigms while putting the Celsius community first.</p>



<p>Celsius distributes 80% of its earnings to network members as prizes, while the remaining 20% goes toward project expansion. The Celsius community is prioritized in this value offer, disrupting traditional banking methods. The Celsius Network creates an integrated ecosystem by combining its portfolio of goods with its native CEL token alongside significant digital assets and fiat currencies.</p>



<h2>How does Celsius work?</h2>



<p>The Celsius Network comprises Celsius-hosted accounts and several crypto exchanges to limit crypto-asset transfers outside of the system.</p>



<p>In the end, the Celsius system is made up of four crucial players:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Lenders:</strong> Depositors who receive interest on their account&#8217;s assets.</li><li><strong>Borrowers:</strong> Margin traders that want to take short or long leveraged positions.</li><li><strong>Celsius Platform:</strong> Facilitates transactions, monitors risk, and calculates trading fees.</li><li><strong>External exchange markets:</strong> Executes deals and borrows/provides liquidity in the external exchange markets.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>Earning</strong></h3>



<p>Participants deposit crypto assets on the Celsius network to make extra money and receive incentives in various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDC.</p>



<p>Celsius controls assets put in a &#8216;Lending <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-whats-better/" data-wpel-link="internal">Stake Pool</a>,&#8217; which are then loaned to other exchanges, and the interest earned is shared among users.</p>



<p>Celsius utilizes a modified Proof-of-Stake (PoS) formula to calculate the distribution given to lenders. The interest paid to lenders is a function of the cash placed and the number of days participating in Celsius&#8217; consensus method.</p>



<h3><strong>Borrowing</strong></h3>



<p>Several users would want to use the Celsius platform to borrow money.</p>



<ul><li><strong>General Users</strong> – Users that deposit crypto on the Celsius Network and utilize the funds as collateral to acquire a loan.</li><li><strong>Traders</strong> – The accredited investors (or SEC-registered funds) who borrow capital from Celsius lending pools to trade. These accounts require a minimum balance of $10k to cover potential losses and fees in certain trading activities.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Exchanges</strong> – Institutions borrowing from Celsius loan pools will require additional liquidity to settle transactions.</li></ul>



<p>So, that was a detailed explanation of what the Celsius network is and how it works. Next, let&#8217;s look at what&#8217;s happening in the aftermath of the Celsius network&#8217;s demise.</p>



<h2>What&#8217;s happening with the Celcius network?</h2>



<p>The digital token of Celsius Network Ltd. fell approximately 20% on Friday, June 10th, 2022, as concerns grow about the long-term viability of the high returns being provided by the lending platform and others in the crypto market in the aftermath of the Terra blockchain&#8217;s failure.</p>



<p>According to its website, Celsius&#8217;s CEL coin offers &#8220;real cash benefits,&#8221; including up to 30% more weekly returns. However, according to pricing statistics site <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/celsius-network-token" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">CoinGecko</a>, CEL sold at roughly 53 cents, down 21% in the last 24 hours.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a snapshot view of what the decline looked like:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="845" src="https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-1024x845.png" alt="" class="wp-image-23382" srcset="https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-1024x845.png 1024w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-300x248.png 300w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-768x634.png 768w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-141x116.png 141w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image.png 1066w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/celsius-network-token" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">CoinGecko</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>While the cause of the current drop is unknown, demand for high-yielding lending methods has dropped since <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/luna-2-0-the-revival-plan-for-terra/" data-wpel-link="internal">Terra&#8217;s failure</a> in May. Depositors of TerraUSD (UST) stablecoins were promised payouts as high as 20% on the dead blockchain, which was the primary driver of Terra&#8217;s growth. Celsius has acknowledged its Terra exposure but has previously stated that it was able to avoid Terra&#8217;s issue early on.</p>



<p>In a public statement, Celsius recognized the drop but noted that the price is frequently influenced by market factors unrelated to the company&#8217;s performance.</p>



<p>&#8220;Looking across the entire crypto sector, we are undoubtedly in a crypto winter. The price of all cryptocurrencies has clearly been affected by a general market downturn. We are squarely focused on building for the long-term,&#8221; the statement stated.</p>



<h2>Rehypothecation &#8211; One possible reason behind the fall</h2>



<p>Rehypothecation is thought to be one of the causes of the Celsius network&#8217;s demise.</p>



<p>To figure out what&#8217;s going on with Celsius, we need to know what this phrase means. What do you suppose Celsius does with your ETH when you deposit it to earn 6% or USDC to earn 7.1 percent? Do they just sit on your money and keep it in your account?</p>



<p>To pay you interest, they need to make money on that money, like other investment organizations that operate with deposits, whether banks or otherwise. Net Interest Margin is the phrase used in banking to describe this. This is where they charge 5% for a loan and offer you 1% in interest. The Net Interest Margin is one of the banking business&#8217;s most significant ratios and KPIs, accounting for 4% of the difference. Celsius is doing the same thing.</p>



<p>Rehypothecation is when Celsius makes money by lending out your collateral. But, once again, that&#8217;s an oversimplification. What if a business borrowed money and then lent it out with your collateral?</p>



<p>We now have a corporation that functions as a fractional reserve bank, similar to a traditional bank. And that&#8217;s a bad thing. Since loan and investment losses might result in the loss of your collateral and the company&#8217;s losses, you assumed the collateral was safe.</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> This helps keep the prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and other long-running blue-chip projects low.</p>



<h2>Final thoughts</h2>



<p>While short in liquidity, Celsius might be solvent and even profitable. But we don&#8217;t know, and considering some of the collateral mismanagement and ETH losses, we don&#8217;t believe this is the case. So if you believe the dangers at Celsius currently outweigh the profits, you should reduce your investment and sell the token if you have it.</p>

<p>A dedicated community has sprouted around bitcoin over the last decade. It&#8217;s impossible to say whether or not this cryptocurrency will become the world&#8217;s reserve currency or a universally acknowledged store of value like gold. Some investors are wary of the thrill of riches or ruin, but others are eager to pursue the possibility of massive profits from investing in bitcoin. In 2022, Bitcoin is far less risky than it was in 2012 and is a breakthrough technology. El Salvador&#8217;s decision to make bitcoin legal tender in 2021 is likely to inspire other governments to follow suit, while others may reject it outright in an effort to preserve their fiat currency. In the current geopolitical landscape, Bitcoin has taken center stage, and 2022 appears to be the year of widespread adoption.</p>



<p>Buying Bitcoin, like any speculative investment, definitely involves risk. Bitcoin was the first digital asset that spawned today&#8217;s crypto economy. For a long time, it had an underground following of investors who regarded it as a potential substitute for the physical monetary system. Bitcoin has now become a household name as institutions and governments seek to meet their consumers&#8217; increasing need for exposure.</p>



<p>As traditional finance recognizes Bitcoin&#8217;s potential for disruption, they must choose whether to accept cryptocurrencies or not. Ultimately, the decision to invest in bitcoin boils down to your risk tolerance and your perspective on the future of finance. Traditional investors may be interested in Bitcoin as a measure to safeguard themselves against inflation and the possible collapse of the fiat-based financial system. However, Bitcoin&#8217;s volatility is a major concern for many investors, although it is predicted to diminish indefinitely as institutions and governments become involved.</p>



<p>In order to receive a better exchange rate for your Bitcoin, you need to know when to buy it. In general, Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market are volatile, and price fluctuations range from minutes to days and even months. Hence, timing is crucial to make the most out of your cryptocurrency investment.</p>



<h2><strong>What&#8217;s the right time to invest in Bitcoin?</strong></h2>



<p>At a time when an asset&#8217;s value is expected to rise, buying it for a low price is considered a sound investment approach. When comparing Bitcoin&#8217;s value since April, one may argue that it has seen a price drop. Again, predicting when Bitcoin will rise or fall further is difficult. There is no such thing as a perfect time to invest in Bitcoins. However, if your goal is long-term gains, you might consider buying during a dip or during bear markets and holding it until you earn a profit.</p>



<h2><strong>Buying the Dip in Bull Markets</strong></h2>



<p>In the classical definition, dip implies rapidly or briefly immersing anything in liquid. However, in the domain of cryptocurrencies, a dip is the act of buying an item after its value has fallen. Buying a dip implies that you have a chance to invest in a currency or token whose value has declined in the short or long term<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>This strategy is best suited for a bull market or a stagnant market, when the general trend is up or sideways, as opposed to bear markets where the general trend is downwards.</p>



<p>Dip buying can even lessen your average cost of holding a position; nevertheless, the risk and benefits of dip-buying must be examined on a constant basis.</p>



<p>Remember that buying the dip does not guarantee you any profits. An asset&#8217;s price might fall for a variety of reasons, including changes in its fundamental worth. Simply because the price is lower than it has ever been in its history does not suggest that the asset offers good value.</p>



<p>Looking at the charts might help you spot dips. Candlesticks are an excellent tool for detecting possible dips. A green candle indicates that the price has climbed since the candle&#8217;s inception. A red candle, on the other hand, implies a price drop. Dips can be identified as one or numerous red candles in succession, depending on the time range you&#8217;re looking at. Buying the dip is purchasing an asset at the very bottom of the previous red candle before the trend flips and prices begin to rise again.</p>



<p>However, while it sounds quite simple, a trader must do thorough market research to confirm that the current trend is not a bear market and the chances of prices further collapsing from that position are less.</p>



<h2><strong>Investing in Bear Markets</strong></h2>



<p>A bear market occurs when the value of cryptocurrencies has plummeted by at least 20% and continues to fall. One well-known example is the December 2017 cryptocurrency crash, in which investors witnessed a Bitcoin plunge from $20,000 to $3,200 in a matter of days.</p>



<p>A declining bear market is defined as a 20% or more drop from previous highs. As a result, prices are low and continue to fall. The downward trend also influences investors&#8217; outlook and perpetuates the downward trend. The name &#8220;bear&#8221; is said to derive from a bear&#8217;s fighting style, which involves beginning high and hitting with claws downward and all of its weight pressing down.</p>



<p>Bear markets lack the broad optimism and confidence that most investors experience during bull markets.</p>



<p>Typically, crypto traders like to buy assets during a bear market, particularly at rock bottom. However, it may be difficult to determine when a bear market has finished, making it difficult for investors to incur the risk of buying a low-value cryptocurrency that may or may not recover.</p>



<p>Prices often fall when the market learns about unfavorable conditions involving a specific cryptocurrency or asset. The negative spiral drives more individuals to delay investments because they believe that more bad news is on the way and that they should prepare themselves for the worst.</p>



<p>Some panic and sell their holdings, contributing to the downward trend. Bear markets ultimately calm down, and investors gradually regain confidence, ushering in a new bull cycle.</p>



<p>Investing in a bear market is generally riskier because prices are lower, and investors have little to no faith in cryptocurrencies. However, this risk is accompanied by the chance of larger future returns. As a result, you may buy cryptocurrencies at lower prices and sell them at the top of the next bull market.</p>



<p>Another method used by investors is to sell their existing assets as soon as they discover a downtrend and then purchase them back later at a much lower price as the market keeps falling. All of this, however, requires some fundamental understanding of how to analyze charts.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s impossible to pinpoint how long a bear market will persist, especially if it&#8217;s caused by a recession or other similar situations. So the problem is that no one knows how long the price drop will last or how far prices can fall. As a result, you may make an illogical buy or lose out on a great investment.</p>



<h2><strong>Is NOW a good time to buy Bitcoin?</strong></h2>



<p>To understand if now is the right time to invest in Bitcoin, we must first gauge the market&#8217;s overall sentiment.</p>



<p>The &#8220;Bitcoin Monthly&#8221; <a href="https://ark-invest.com/crypto-reports/bitcoin-monthly-2022-05/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">report</a> from Ark Invest, issued by CEO Cathie Wood and other ARK Invest experts, includes a crypto market overview as well as insights on relevant on-chain activities over the past month.</p>



<p>According to the report, &#8216;hodlers&#8217; are stronger than ever, with 66% of Bitcoin&#8217;s supply remaining unchanged for almost a year. This demonstrates the market&#8217;s longer-term commitment as well as a current holder base with greater conviction.</p>



<p>The analysis that follows confirms that, according to Glassnode data, short-term investments plummeted -35% below their breakeven price. This proportion was last observed in January 2022, July 2020, and March 2020. The aggregate long-term and short-term holdings remain above the breakeven price, implying that widespread capitulation has not materialized.</p>



<p>Bitcoin futures open interest has also reached an all-time high of about 480,000 BTC. Overall, Ark Invest remains positive on the Open Interest analysis, indicating that Bitcoin&#8217;s Perpetual Contracts are now trading at a highly bullish discount to the spot market.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, it&#8217;s not just Ark investments. Several other analysts have also voiced similar opinions. However, as of now, Bitcoin continues its sideways movement, and it is yet to be seen which direction the trend continues from here.</p>



<h2><strong>We are still early</strong></h2>



<p>Ultimately, it all comes down to whether or not you are comfortable investing in current conditions. There&#8217;s no simple answer to what&#8217;s the best time to buy bitcoin. If you are looking at the bigger picture, we are still early in the game, and Bitcoin, along with the entire industry, has a lot of room to grow. This means more opportunities for investors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the wake of the unexpected collapse of the Terra stablecoins Luna and UST, the financial world has learned a harsh lesson. People need reliable financial services that aren&#8217;t going to wreak havoc on people&#8217;s finances in a matter of days.</p>



<p>Advocates of TerraUSD (UST), a dollar-pegged stablecoin, anticipated it would upend existing payment systems throughout the world. However, it was quickly depleted as investors panicked and rushed to withdraw their cash, resulting in a violent, self-enforcing bank run. The crypto market capitalization of almost $400 billion was wiped out as a result of the crisis, which bankrupted many investors.</p>



<p>Terra&#8217;s demise might have short-term and long-term consequences for the crypto industry and beyond, especially when lawmakers and regulators who are wary of the technology take a closer look at the damage.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s begin by looking at the entire chain of events that unfolded.</p>



<h2>Dissecting the Crash</h2>



<p>Without prior knowledge of the blockchain, Terra&#8217;s rapid rise and downfall can be difficult to explain effectively. Indeed, many of its supporters used obfuscation and rhetoric to mask some of its glaring shortcomings.</p>



<p>Terra has its own blockchain, much like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Its flagship product is the UST stablecoin, which is linked to the US dollar. Stablecoins are utilized as safe havens by crypto traders when markets in DeFi (decentralized finance) get choppy: rather than changing their more volatile assets into hard cash, which may be costly and trigger tax implications, traders simply exchange them for stablecoins.</p>



<p>Some stablecoins get their value from being fully backed by reserves: if investors choose to withdraw their funds, the stablecoin&#8217;s foundation should theoretically have enough cash on hand to refund them all at once. On the other hand, UST is an algorithmic stablecoin that depends on code, continual market activity, and sheer trust to maintain its peg to the US dollar. The theoretical support for UST&#8217;s peg was also provided by its computational connection to Terra&#8217;s basic currency, Luna.</p>



<p>Investment in UST surged in the past months as a result of a platform called Anchor, which provided a 20% return to those who purchased the token and committed it to the protocol. When this opportunity was announced, many detractors quickly compared it to a Ponzi scam, claiming that Terra could not possibly give such a large return to all of its investors. Terra team members recognized this but compared the pricing to a marketing expense to create awareness, similar to how Uber and Lyft gave heavily reduced fares at the start of their operations.</p>



<p>What started at 20% and was billed as &#8220;stable&#8221; gradually began to fall following the passing of Proposal 20 in March. This proposal indicated that if Anchor&#8217;s reserves rose by 5%, the interest rate would rise. If these reserves fell by 5%, the interest rate would fall as well.</p>



<p>Furthermore, if there were more lenders than borrowers on the platform, this rate was predicted to fall by 1.5 percentage points per month. With interest rates predicted to decline, the primary use case for UST began to wane. On April 23, for example, Anchor held more than 72 percent of the UST in circulation. The entire point of this stablecoin was for it to be invested in Anchor.</p>



<p>When it became evident that the 20% interest rate was not going to persist, UST holders began to flee.</p>



<p>On Friday, May 6, there were around 14 billion UST in Anchor. By Sunday, the tally had dropped to 11.7 billion. Note, UST was still pretty much tied to the dollar at the time; thus, around $2.3 billion in capital was gone over the weekend.</p>



<p>And, given that UST holders were only engaged in the Terra network because of Anchor, their departures meant they had no purpose for that UST. As a result, we experienced a massive outflow.</p>



<p>You have two alternatives for exiting UST. The first option is Terra&#8217;s widely popular burn-and-mint system.</p>



<p>Holders can use this technique to exchange one UST for one LUNA, destroying the UST in the process. Whenever 1 UST goes below $1, this presents an arbitrage opportunity, as speculators may buy the discounted UST and swap it in for $1 in LUNA, generating a little profit. The inverse is also true: if UST trades for more than $1, you can swap (and burn) $1 of LUNA for that UST.</p>



<p>The second option is to use the stablecoin exchange Curve Finance.</p>



<p>When a stablecoin has a minor price fluctuation, savvy arbitrageurs will often rush over to DeFi&#8217;s biggest liquidity pools on Curve and trade the discounted stablecoin to whatever alternative has maintained its peg.</p>



<p>For instance, if DAI is trading at $0.99, investors will purchase the discounted DAI and sell it for USDC (in this case, $1) to profit. Normally, this buying pressure drives the price of DAI back up to $1. This is also true for UST.</p>



<p>Now, let&#8217;s take a look at why things went so wrong for UST.</p>



<p>First, there&#8217;s the burn-and-mint exit. The UST supply cratered as it burnt, whereas the LUNA supply mooned. This was also not a painless exit, as consumers encountered a number of technological challenges.</p>



<p>Remember that Terra is a blockchain network with gas fees for operations. Along with rising gas prices, the network is also constrained in terms of how much UST or LUNA can be burnt or minted at once. Because things were slow and clogged, exchanges began to pause withdrawals.</p>



<p>This burn-and-mint method could potentially have an effect on the LUNA pricing.</p>



<p>Swapping and burning UST for LUNA generates more LUNA, decreasing the supply and reducing the price of this token. Furthermore, as the price of LUNA lowers, exchanging 1 UST for $1 worth of LUNA will require more and more LUNA to reach the $1 threshold.</p>



<p>At some point, LUNA&#8217;s price might drop so low that there isn&#8217;t enough liquidity to absorb all the UST flowing in.</p>



<p>As for Curve Finance, here&#8217;s how it looked.</p>



<p>Over the weekend, UST fell by less than $0.02 as Anchor users jumped in and began trading UST for any other stablecoin, such as Tether&#8217;s USDT or Circle&#8217;s USDC.</p>



<p>Eventually, the pool that permitted these transactions (dubbed the &#8220;UST + 3Crv&#8221; pool, which also included all of the major stablecoins) became imbalanced, meaning there was considerably more UST in the pool than the other stablecoins.</p>



<p><strong>What happens when you sell UST for USDC on Curve?</strong></p>



<p>If you sell UST on Curve for USDC, you will add additional UST to this pool while removing USDC. The pool will eventually include more UST than USDC. To correct course, the pool begins to offer that UST at a discount with the aim of convincing arbitrageurs to execute the opposite transaction (and rebalance the pool).</p>



<p>This is why we started seeing a tiny de-pegging over the weekend—Curve was doing what it has been doing since its inception.</p>



<p>The issue in this scenario was that the opposing trade, which would rebalance the pool, was not taking place. Despite the reasonably profitable arbitrage trade, it appeared that no one wanted to be in control of UST. As for why, keep in mind that Terra&#8217;s flagship app, Anchor, has begun to falter.</p>



<p>Soon one investor sold almost 85 million UST tokens in return for 84.5 million USDC tokens in this pool. This, of course, increased pressure on UST&#8217;s dollar peg as Curve continued to generate the discount in the hopes of incentivizing arbitrage traders to rebalance the pool.</p>



<p>A $0.02 devaluation on Sunday became a staggering $0.32 by Tuesday. Simultaneously, the $64 LUNA token plummeted below $30.</p>



<p>Around this time, UST&#8217;s market value began to overtake LUNA&#8217;s, implying that the latter would no longer be able to soak up the former, resulting in a state of collapse. This is when the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) naturally intervened.</p>



<p>It put a ton of non-UST stablecoins into the Curve pool to help the stablecoin establish its peg. It then apparently began deploying its Bitcoin holdings to a &#8220;professional market maker,&#8221; who was effectively directed to spend BTC when UST fell below the peg. As such, UST rose from $0.64 to $0.93, but momentarily.</p>



<p>Constant exits via Curve depleted the bailout liquidity. It&#8217;s also unknown whether the BTC was ever utilized to defend the peg.</p>



<p>Eventually, when people abandoned UST and subsequently sold their LUNA, the price of LUNA fell so low there wasn&#8217;t enough headroom for UST, resulting in a massive amount of bad debt.</p>



<p>Do Kwon and the Terra community doubled down and expanded the amount of LUNA that may be coined at one time. But all it did was speed up the spiral. On May 8, LUNA had a circulating supply of 343 million. By May 12, the total had risen to 32.3 billion.</p>



<p>Despite the negative feedback loop, the Terra community offered three more emergency actions, all of which came down to just setting fire to as much UST as possible (without having to mint LUNA on the other end).</p>



<h2>What are the lessons to be taken away?</h2>



<p>The most apparent is that cryptocurrencies are risky, but you presumably already knew that.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s look at the shortcomings in the design. In theory, when you peg one asset with another asset as collateral, there is always the possibility of under collateralization or depegging. Even if it is ten times collateralized, the collateral asset might fall more than ten times. Nothing is 100% stable.</p>



<p>The greatest irrational design fault, according to Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, is believing that minting more of an asset would raise its overall worth (market cap). Printing money creates no value; it only dilutes current holders. Exponentially minting LUNA exacerbated the situation.</p>



<p>The overly aggressive incentives were the second basic issue. Anchor&#8217;s 20% fixed APY is specifically designed to encourage (in-organic) development. Incentives may be used to entice users to join your ecosystem. However, in order to sustain it, you must earn &#8220;income,&#8221; that is, more revenue than expenses. Otherwise, you will run out of funds and have to declare bankruptcy.</p>



<p>However, in this scenario, the definition of &#8220;income&#8221; is muddled because the project team most likely considered their own token sales or price appreciation of LUNA as &#8220;income.&#8221; This strategy is flawed. Yes, people come in because of the incentives, and the value of LUNA rises. And more people are receiving incentives. But no value is generated.</p>



<p>We must always remember that high APYs don&#8217;t always indicate healthy projects.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s now clear that the entire system was founded on a self-perpetuating, superficial premise. While Terra did have an ecosystem with certain use cases, the ecosystem&#8217;s expansion did not keep pace with the incentives employed to attract new users. The development was &#8220;hollow.&#8221; This resulted in its complete collapse.</p>



<p>The key takeaway here is to avoid chasing high APY.</p>



<h2>Closing note</h2>



<p>The crypto industry is still in its infancy, and decentralized software platforms like Ethereum provide virtually limitless opportunities for developing alternative financial products. These services have not been tried and tested in the same way that traditional finance has, and things may go wrong quickly and severely.</p>



<p>More specifically, while not intrinsically bad, algorithmic stablecoins are especially risky. A stablecoin that is dollar for dollar-backed by actual cash in a bank somewhere is significantly less likely to lose its peg to the dollar. An algorithmic stablecoin, although always partially backed by something valuable someplace, is complicated. And while everything may appear to be great 99 percent of the time, when the markets begin to crumble, the mechanism preserving its value may fail. This is why looking at the fundamentals over the incentives is important.</p>

<p>Seasonality is an attribute of a time series in which the data undergoes predictable and regular variations across the calendar year. Seasons refer to any predictable riff or pattern that recurs or repeats over one year. Numerous factors, data, and information are manifested in a single price and its movement. From professional analysts to amateurs, investors try to spot trends in asset values to forecast where they will go.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>What are seasons in Crypto?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Similar to the traditional market investors, Crypto investors are looking for a ray of sunshine to outsmart the market. They are always interested in &#8220;timing the market&#8221; and uncovering patterns and trends to influence their entry and exit positions. Crypto investors have already declared numerous &#8220;seasons&#8221; despite the lack of historical data compared to traditional investments. &#8220;Altcoin season,&#8221; &#8220;crypto (or Bitcoin) winter,&#8221; and &#8220;DeFi Summer&#8221; are the most well-known.</p>



<h2>Defi Summer</h2>



<p>In the summer of 2020, something odd happened in the crypto world. In a world where cryptocurrency prices dominate most conversations, a new phenomenon known as <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</a> has begun to capture the interest of crypto fans at an unprecedented rate.</p>



<p>DeFi is a type of blockchain-based finance that employs smart contracts to provide financial instruments without the necessity for traditional intermediaries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In less than two months, the governance token for Yearn Finance, a DeFi Protocol, went from $6 to nearly $30,000. That represents a 500,000% increase in value. The phase was called the &#8220;DeFi Summer of 2020&#8221;.</p>



<h2>AltCoin Season</h2>



<p>Altcoin season is when non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies outperform bitcoin. Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency holding the largest market cap, is well-known and actively traded. Hence, there is a well-known index comparing BTC to non-BTC cryptocurrencies. This indicator, called &#8220;Bitcoin Dominance,&#8221; is defined as the ratio of Bitcoin&#8217;s market cap to the rest of the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>While Bitcoin used to have near-complete domination, altcoins&#8217; presence and expanding popularity have caused Bitcoin&#8217;s supremacy to wane. When the market capitalization of several cryptocurrencies surpasses that of Bitcoin, it may herald the start of an altcoin season.</p>



<p>Altcoins typically outperform Bitcoin during an altcoin season, causing Bitcoin to lose market dominance. As a result, seasoned traders and investors with varied portfolios pay attention to altcoin seasons and make adjustments to their portfolios accordingly.</p>



<h2>Crypto Winter</h2>



<p>A lengthy period of declining prices is referred to as a crypto winter. For example, when the previous crypto winter began in early 2018, bitcoin had lost nearly 87 percent of its value in a year, compared to its all-time high in December 2017. Other cryptocurrencies were hit even harder than bitcoin, with the vast majority falling by 90-95 percent from their all-time highs.</p>



<p>Yes, the market has fallen again. Some experts believe that it is a phase of the crypto autumn; some experts say the winter is here, and some have very clearly stated that the winter, which might be at our doorsteps, is going to be a harsh one.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Cryptocurrencies are a relatively new asset class that is fast expanding. New asset classes go through contraction and expansion cycles regardless of the calendar page.</p>



<p>We cannot exclude the possibility of a new altcoin season or a harsh crypto winter. However, anticipating any &#8220;crypto season&#8221; from historical calendar data is difficult right now. It will only be the market that will tell us.</p>

<h2><strong>About GHST</strong></h2>



<p>Aavegotchi (GHST) is a series of rare crypto-collectibles living on Ethereum. Aavegotchis predate most contemporary play-to-earn games as they were among the first ERC-721-based NFT games. They introduced innovative concepts now standard to many blockchain games like dynamic rarity, rarity farming, DeFi mechanics like staking, DAO-governed game mechanics, and an open metaverse with interoperable smart contracts. Aavegotchi runs on the Aave protocol. Simply put, Aavegotchis are game avatars that can be used as DeFi collateral to earn staking rewards.</p>

<p>How is Google, one of the most influential tech companies, utilizing decentralization?</p>



<p>Big IT businesses have been paying greater attention to blockchain innovations. Although the support of a well-known brand like Google may help to propel blockchain into the mainstream, there is still space for improvement from both blockchain developers and prominent mainstream firms.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s no surprise they&#8217;ve been looking at the possibilities blockchains may provide for a long time. As of 2021, Google has its fingers in many blockchain pies. So naturally, they have a massive infrastructure spread around the globe, and numerous blockchains may profit from it without worrying about maintaining their backend.</p>



<p>In this blog, we have listed a few projects in which Google has been involved.</p>



<h2>Google&#8217;s first measured approach</h2>



<p>Google released a blog article in June 2019 hinting that merging distributed ledgers with current internet resources and public cloud services has advantages.</p>



<p>Many people have been amazed by this new hybrid cloud-blockchain method. Because Google used Ethereum (ETH) for this, it was evident that the corporation had done extensive research into the technology. It was a step toward making publicly available blockchain data over Google Cloud, which has been known for years.</p>



<p>Using <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/a-short-guide-to-chainlink/" data-wpel-link="internal">Chainlink (LINK)</a> oracles to connect Ethereum smart contracts to Google&#8217;s business cloud data warehouse highlights the technology&#8217;s potential. It also emphasizes the possibility of utilizing Chainlink services to deliver on-chain data to eliminate inefficiencies and bring new capabilities.</p>



<h2>Google pay transactions</h2>



<p>In many jurisdictions, the question of integrating the DeFi and fiat worlds is still a concern. However, the desire for seamless integration of crypto and fiat payment mechanisms is growing among businesses. People want to utilize the one-stop shop to buy and sell cryptocurrency in dollars.</p>



<p>Google approached a peer-to-peer online BTC exchange about the viability of Google Pay transactions. And they were successful! Users may already purchase Bitcoin using the Google Pay app on their phones.</p>



<p>Another exchange took it a step further by launching its Visa payment cards. Google Pay and their pool of crypto money were merged to conduct quick transactions with any suppliers. Consequently, a user may pay for items and services with crypto using a physical debit card from their exchange&#8217;s balance.</p>



<p>In reality, there&#8217;s a lot more going on behind the scenes. Nonetheless, this is a ground-breaking application that effectively transforms cryptocurrencies into &#8220;regular&#8221; money in the real world.</p>



<h2>Google and Theta lab partnership</h2>



<p>When Google Cloud teamed with Theta Labs, a decentralized video streaming platform, the company&#8217;s involvement with blockchain technology took an exciting turn in early 2020. It appeared at first to be a small-scale collaboration. Still, the partnership&#8217;s ambition was revealed when it was revealed that any Google Cloud customer might deploy Theta&#8217;s blockchain network to experiment with the technology.</p>



<p>Google Cloud set up a Theta Network (THETA) validator node to support users across Europe as part of this arrangement. Google Cloud has since become an integral element of the Theta ecosystem. Theta&#8217;s network is also the seventh blockchain to make its data publicly available through Google&#8217;s public dataset initiative.</p>



<h2>Serving BigQuery for developers</h2>



<p>BigQuery is Google&#8217;s first foray into the blockchain realm. They progressed in this field after creating this one.</p>



<p>BigQuery works with API calls, as in their SQL workspace. Such is why, to obtain that data, you must be at least technologically knowledgeable. By emailing the Google team, you must receive confirmation of your project. When you&#8217;re ready, you can start doing interesting things. Raw data flowing in real-time isn&#8217;t the sole benefit. You may also view the information in various ways, including 3D models and traditional histograms.</p>



<h2>Google explores NFTs and FLOW.</h2>



<p>Dapper Labs, a Canadian blockchain firm that creates <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/why-web-3-0-matters/" data-wpel-link="internal">Web 3.0</a> products and services, has teamed with Google. A Non-Fungible Token (NFT) marketplace is one of the company&#8217;s main principles.</p>



<p>Google Cloud has agreed to act as a network operator for Dapper Labs&#8217; Flow (FLOW) blockchain, enabling a more extensive ecosystem of NFTs, games, and applications as part of a multi-year agreement. Dapper will also be able to expand thanks to Google&#8217;s secure infrastructure. For example, NBA Top Shot and CryptoKitties are two popular NFT projects on Flow.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the Flow blockchain is accessible via Google Cloud, making Flow and Google software interaction much more effortless.</p>



<h2>Final words</h2>



<p>Adding a new blockchain to an already crowded market and simplifying its operation with a native coin has become commonplace. That is something that even the tiniest businesses can accomplish, and Google is not one of them. They already have a large number of assets. Moreover, they have exceptional minds in technology, business, marketing, and science on their team.</p>



<p>As a result, we should not be surprised if Google takes steps beyond merely developing a blockchain. This search whale is a perfect example of what a good blockchain may become, assuming it&#8217;s based on a decentralized ledger. So, let&#8217;s see how Google plans to establish itself in the developing blockchain business.</p>

<p><em>As per a report by CoinGecko, the NFT market is estimated to grow by more than </em><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-nft-sector-is-projected-to-move-around-800-billion-over-next-2-years-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><em>$800 billion </em></a><em>in the next two years. According to the report, roughly 72% of the respondents in the Asia and Pacific region already have at least one NFT, with more than half having five or more.</em> </p>



<p>For the uninitiated, NFTs are simply certificates of ownership minted over a blockchain that represent a digital or a real-world asset, like an artwork, a collectible, a piece of music, or memorabilia. Since Beeple’s artwork sold for $69 million at a Christie’s auction, NFTs have become a rage among the internet masses. The NFT industry is billions of dollars worth currently and will grow, given the umpteen possibilities the NFT technology possesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Iconic brands like Nike, Louis Vuitton, Tanishq, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, McDonald’s, Samsung, Lamborghini, and many others have released their NFT collections to expand their marketing and brand promotion to the digital realm while at the same time creating customer engagement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Celebrities and influencers haven’t been far behind in the NFT race. Global names like Lindsay Lohan, Shawn Medes, Eminem, Madonna, etc., have dropped their NFT collections for their fans. NFTs have changed the way how we look at ownership and digital marketing. Unsurprisingly, the NFT world has been expanding like never before, and Indian celebrities haven’t been left untouched by the NFT fever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vishakha Singh, vice president at WazirX Marketplace, believes that celebrity participation in the NFT segment will help in creating greater excitement and adoption among the Indian masses. She <a href="https://www.vccircle.com/global-investors-are-looking-at-india-as-the-next-silicon-valley-of-the-world-says-claude-smadja-president-smadja-smadja-former-world-economic-forum-managing-director" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">said</a>, &#8221; (this) is great for the ecosystem. This will help us in garnering more awareness towards this new game-changing world of digital assets.”</p>



<p>Let’s look at some of the bigwigs from the entertainment and fashion industry in India:&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Amitabh Bachchan</h2>



<p>Amitabh Bachchan, the legendary Bollywood actor, joined the NFT bandwagon in November 2021. He launched Madhushala, his father&#8217;s renowned poetry recitation, as part of his NFT collection, which included autographed Sholay posters and other memorabilia connected to the film. The collection was auctioned for Rs. 7.18 crores through an NFT marketplace.</p>



<h2>Salman Khan</h2>



<p>The Dabangg star launched his NFT collection based on his movie Dabangg. He launched the NFT series, which had 200 NFTs, of which 42 were movie scenes. Salman Khan announced on Twitter about his NFT series on 25th December 2021, and the collection went live on 30th December 2021. Fans could buy NFTs using ETH or MATIC tokens.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Rajnikanth</h2>



<p>Superstar Rajinikanth launched his NFT collectibles based on his 2007 Tamil action film Shivaji The Boss in July 2021, collaborating with Singapore-based NFT marketplace Diginoor.io. The prices ranged from $99 to $1500 and were sold out pretty quickly.</p>



<h2>Kamal Hassan</h2>



<p>Kamal Haasan, a well-known South Superstar, and politician has partnered with celebrity NFT platform Fantico to auction his movie NFT collectibles. The dates of the release of the NFT collection have not been disclosed yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kamal Hassan will launch around 100 to 1000 NFTs based on movie posters, souvenirs, avatars, etc. Fantico plans to develop a metaverse game where each avatar has its world. Participants and fans will have the opportunity to engage with the avatar, purchase memorabilia, and even attend meet-and-greet sessions.</p>



<h2>Manish Malhotra</h2>



<p>Manish Malhotra, India&#8217;s leading fashion designer, is the country&#8217;s first in his sector to enter the crypto realm. Manish Malhotra launched five NFTs based on sketches and runway GIFs of his couture that were worn by Deepika Padukone, Kareena Kapoor, Lisa Ray, and Alia Bhatt in October 2021. The collection was sold on the WazirX marketplace, and the NFT, which was based on one of his outfits’ sketches worn by Kareena Kapoor, was called Illuminous Showstopper and fetched the highest price of 3,000 WRX.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Sunny Leone</h2>



<p>Sunny Leone becomes the first Indian actress to release her own NFT collection &#8211; Misfitz, by Sunny Leone. The collection was marked by quirky motifs, loud characters, and eclectic vibes. The collection had around 9600 NFTs and was sold out pretty quickly in November of 2021.</p>



<p>The NFTs and Bollywood&#8217;s union is solely led by the actor&#8217;s fan following and influence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ever since the introduction of digitalization in 2020, NFTs have had the opportunity to flourish and find their niche in India. However, NFTs gained momentum when Indian celebrity moguls, athletes, musicians, actors, humanitarians, and others, started taking an interest in them and went ahead and launched their own collections. The NFT fever and fervor aren’t yet subsiding, and we will soon see many more known names and personalities joining the list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Suppose you are interested in buying and selling NFTs or even minting them; the<a href="https://nft.wazirx.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"> WazirX NFT marketplace</a> presents a great opportunity to do so at affordable fees, and the trust and security associated with the brand is the icing on the cake. </p>

<p>Markets, traditional or crypto, have been both strangers to “stability”. Fluctuations are seen as the only truth in markets, and we have witnessed this recently in the crypto market more than ever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From Bitcoin to Ethereum, Coins have faced the brunt of the negative trend of 2022. While we witnessed the plummeting of major coins in red, there was a unique kind of behavior portrayed by some stable coins despite the plunging market.</p>



<p>Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to a stable asset like precious metals or fiat currencies like the US dollar. The multiple stablecoin categories are based on the assets that back them up. Stablecoins&#8217; value is less susceptible to price movements because of their backing by other assets, hence the name.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During transactions, they provide quick processing, security, and privacy of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. In addition, they have stable prices and are not as volatile as other cryptocurrencies, hence, providing a win-win situation for the investor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let us look at the types of stablecoins in the market.</p>



<h2>Types of Stablecoins</h2>



<h3>Fiat-collateralized Stablecoins</h3>



<p>Fiat-collateralized stablecoins are backed by a fiat currency such as the Euro, the British Pound, or the US Dollar. Fiat-collateralized stablecoins hold a fiat currency reserve as collateral for producing a sufficient amount of cryptocurrency coins.</p>



<p>Major examples of Fiat-Collateralised Stablecoins are USD Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Commodity Collateralised Stablecoins</h3>



<p>Tangible assets such as precious metals, oil, and real estate are used to back commodity-backed stablecoins. Gold is the most commonly utilized commodity as collateral for commodity-backed stablecoins. Owners of commodity-collateralized stablecoins are effectively exercising ownership over a commodity. Commodities, in general, have the potential to appreciate in value over time. Hence, these kinds of stablecoins offer the possibility of higher incentives.</p>



<p>Gold Security Currency (GSX), Tether Gold (XAUT), and Paxos Gold (PAXG) are some of the most popular gold-backed stablecoins.</p>



<h3>Crypto-collateralized Stablecoins</h3>



<p>Stablecoins that are crypto-collateralized are backed by other cryptocurrencies. Because the reserve cryptocurrency may be volatile, such stablecoins are over-collateralized, meaning that the value of the cryptocurrency held in reserves exceeds the value of the stablecoins produced. Decentralization is the most important characteristic of Crypto-Collateralised Stablecoin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stablecoins supported by crypto could help processes become more trustless by improving security and transparency. The benefit of decentralization is that a single body does not control your finances. Furthermore, some crypto-backed stablecoins have many cryptocurrencies backing them to ensure efficient risk distribution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An example of Crypto-Collateralised Stablecoins is DAI. Dai was backed by Ether when it was introduced.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Algorithmic Stablecoins</h3>



<p>The prices of algorithmic (non-collateralized) stablecoins are maintained using a method similar to that of a central bank but without the need for reserves. Such operations are similar to central bank printing banknotes to maintain the value of a fiat currency. This can be done by launching a decentralized network with a self-contained smart contract.</p>



<p>In essence, algorithmic stablecoins could provide stability based on market supply and demand. It&#8217;s also worth noting that algorithmic stablecoins have the greatest degree of decentralization and independence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The difference is that a central bank transparently determines monetary policy based on well-defined parameters, and its standing as a legal tender issuer adds to the credibility of that policy.</p>



<p>In a crisis, algorithmic stablecoin issuers cannot rely on such advantages. For instance, on May 11, 2022, the price of the TerraUSD (UST) algorithmic stablecoin plummeted by more than 60%, destroying its peg to the US dollar, while the price of the sister Luna token used to peg Terra plummeted by more than 80%.</p>



<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>



<p>Stablecoins are backed by either collateral or by the demand-supply algorithm. They are a lesser volatile alternative to investing in the highly volatile crypto market &#8211; yet are not foolproof. Hence, investors should do their own research before investing in the market.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>About PSG</strong></h2>



<p>The Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) Fan Token is a cryptocurrency directly related to the Paris Saint Germain football club. This means that, for instance, when the club signs a new player — such as star Lionel Messi (who took a part of his salary in $PSG tokens) — the token usually rises in value, as fans want to play a role in supporting and making leadership decisions for their club through meaningful real-world interactions. Unlike NFT, fan tokens are fungible, meaning just like fiat or cash, they can be exchanged for exclusive merchandise or fan experiences.</p>



<ul><li>Trading price (at the time of writing): $7.62 USD</li><li>Global Market Cap (at the time of writing): $23,719,007 USD</li><li>Global Trading Volume (at the time of writing): $22,471,461 USD</li><li>Circulating Supply: 3,111,216 PSG</li><li>Total Supply: 20,000,000 PSG</li></ul>

<p>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are often seen as the future of ownership for users since they have the potential to transform the way assets are recorded, validated, exchanged, and used.</p>



<p>NFT sales volume surged to $10.7 billion in the third quarter of 2021. In addition, Blockasset, a planned NFT collecting and marketplace platform for athletes, aims to expand the NFT market by leveraging Solana&#8217;s unique features to offer the advantages of NFTs to hundreds of millions of sports fans across the world.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s get into understanding what blockassets are?</p>



<h2>Blockassets: An introduction</h2>



<p>Blockasset is a new-fangled technology platform that connects athletes and fans by offering real-world experiences, incentives, and one-of-a-kind digital collectibles.</p>



<p>Blockasset is a validated <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/future-of-nfts/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFT ecosystem</a> that connects athletes and their fans. Using our own NFT marketplace, blockchain NFT tickets, and blockchain NFT gaming, we use strategic partnerships with players, agents, and clubs to link them to fans.</p>



<p>Blockasset is built on the Metaplex protocol to lure professional athletes into the ecosystem. We offer unequaled real-life experiences and prizes tied to collector objects officially certified by the athletes themselves by working directly with sports players worldwide. We will be launching a token with staking, liquidity, and incentives in the near future.</p>



<h2>Range of services provided by Blockassets</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Avatar creation:</strong> Users can construct their own Blockasset NFT avatar after registering on the platform.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Marketplace:</strong> The Blockasset marketplace provides an open and transparent market for buying and selling NFTs with fast transactions and ultra-low costs, and the ability to enhance listings using $BLOCK tokens.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Fiat Gateway:</strong> Blockasset&#8217;s fiat gateway enables individuals without a prior understanding of cryptography to purchase NFTs, allowing them to get exposure to their advantages.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Collection page:</strong> Each user is given a sticker book that serves as an NFT display page for displaying their current NFT collections.</li></ul>



<h2>Blockasset&#8217;s Aim</h2>



<p>The platform will consist of three main components: a blockchain NFT (Non-Fungible-Token) marketplace – the ecosystem&#8217;s primary hub, an NFT ticketing facility, and an NFT gaming suite. Meanwhile, the components work together to form the Blockasset ecosystem, which provides fans and athletes with various touchpoints for virtual and real-world involvement.</p>



<p>Blockasset has evolved into more than merely an NFT platform, focusing on the power of play to gain gaming economies and how to use athlete exposure to enable wealth transfer and empower people with limited opportunities. The first NFT P2E game to include real-life soccer stars is Block Stars.</p>



<h2>Perks associated with Blockasset</h2>



<p>Being an NFT holder on the platform comes with a slew of benefits, including the following:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Athlete access:</strong> NFT holders have access to unique social networks that include frequent athlete AMAs, exclusive video chats, and other benefits.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Athlete content:</strong> NFT holders may express themselves and take on the role of the content creator by sharing ideas for the upcoming athlete video and having early access to unique content before anybody else.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Athlete rewards:</strong> All NFT holders have the opportunity to win real-world prizes like meet and greet, merchandising, and event tickets. These are allocated depending on a lottery system&#8217;s outcomes.</li></ul>



<p>Blockasset&#8217;s sports media division wants to gradually bring NFTs and their unique qualities to the athletic public via an easy, accessible platform that makes owning, utilizing, and trading NFTs simple. This will include athlete-packed YouTube clips, short films, documentaries, podcasts, and exclusive material to reach a large audience.</p>



<h2>How does Blockasset work?</h2>



<p>Through the unique qualities and possibilities of NFTs, Blockasset hopes to connect sports fans with their favorite sportspeople.</p>



<p>The program connects verified athletes with fans via an online platform and marketplace where fans can obtain NFT-based content from companies, athletes, and other suppliers.</p>



<p>Through a range of NFT-based goods, fans will be able to better connect with athletes and other renowned persons through Blockasset and join them as their careers and popularity expand.</p>



<p>To further stratify the way fans connect with athletes and their material, the platform offers the notion of three NFT levels (Legends, Moments, and Gaming).</p>



<p>Legends NFTs have fully authorized NFT collectibles created and backed by some of the greatest athletes in history, each with its benefits. Moments NFTs will be generated and distributed using the quality over quantity strategy, making them the primary collectible assets in the Blockasset ecosystem. Finally, Gaming NFTs assist in powering the economy of various current <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/5-best-metaverse-games-to-play-in-2022/" data-wpel-link="internal">Play to Earn</a> (P2E) sports games, elevating the fan experience to new heights.</p>



<h2>Usage of Blockasset</h2>



<ul><li>Users begin by designing their avatars. The avatar is a one-of-a-kind item with its rarity level and unique governance privileges that can be traded on the Blockasset exchange.</li><li>Complete the onboarding process by creating a user profile. This might entail completing several chores such as purchasing an NFT, adding the avatar to other social media sites such as Facebook, etc.</li><li>After joining up, users may start collecting NFTs by visiting a sticker book-style website. The page may look at all of their current collectibles or link to the marketplace to buy new NFTs using crypto or fiat.</li><li>Vote, connect and interact. NFT holders get access to monthly lotteries, airdrops, and governance privileges while remaining related to their favorite athletes.</li><li>Participate in the community. The platform serves as a gathering place for athlete fans to interact, communicate, and have fun while sharing their favorite athletes&#8217; finest moments.</li></ul>



<h2>Final thoughts</h2>



<p>Blockasset expects that NFT artifacts and experiences can become as popular as traditional ones by lowering the entry barrier.</p>

<h2><strong>About RAMP</strong></h2>



<p>RAMP DeFi is a decentralized protocol that intends to boost DeFi adoption by allowing non-Ethereum (ETH) users to stake tokens on ETH platforms; at the same time, Ethereum users can interact with the RAMP protocol and increase their yields.</p>



<p>RAMP DeFi allows the staked capital of non-ERC-20 staking blockchains to be collateralized into a stablecoin known as rUSD that is issued on the Ethereum blockchain. The main result of this is the maximization of capital efficiency on stacked digital assets, where users earn staking rewards, unlock liquidity from staked assets and stack multiple yield streams at the same time.</p>

<p>Stablecoins, despite their increasing market value in the previous two years, are unlikely to represent the future of payments, according to a <a href="https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2022/02/the-future-of-payments-is-not-stablecoins/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.</p>



<p>In this blog, let&#8217;s find out if stablecoins are the future of payment?</p>



<h2>What are stablecoins?</h2>



<p>Stablecoins are a type of digital asset whose value is linked to the value of other money, commodity, or financial instrument. Stablecoins are designed to provide an alternative to the excessive volatility of the most popular cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC), which has rendered such assets unsuitable for widespread usage in transactions.</p>



<p>To read more about stablecoins, click <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-are-stablecoins/" data-wpel-link="internal">here</a>!</p>



<h2>What do economists say?</h2>



<p>Stablecoins provide lower-cost, safer, real-time, and more competitive payments than what consumers and companies are used-to today, according to experts. As a result, they might make it easier for governments to administer conditional cash transfer programs and make it cheaper for companies to receive payments (including sending stimulus money). In addition, they have the potential to bring unbanked or underbanked people into the financial system.</p>



<p>However, stablecoins are at risk of being everything but stable without strong legal and economic foundations. As a result, they might implode like a faulty currency board, &#8220;break the buck&#8221; like money market funds did in 2008, or spiral into oblivion.</p>



<p>Let’s jump to what liquidity issues stablecoins face to understand the concept of stablecoins better.</p>



<h2>Liquidity issues with stablecoins</h2>



<p>Stablecoins are pegged to a safe asset, such as the US dollar, to stay stable. Stablecoins, according to experts, bind assets needlessly.</p>



<p>According to the researchers, locking up secure and liquid assets in a stablecoin structure prevents them from being used for other objectives, such as assisting banks in meeting regulatory liquidity requirements. As a result, the adoption of stablecoins may result in a scarcity of secure and liquid assets.</p>



<p>Tether, the company behind USDT, the most valuable stablecoin by market capitalization, is one of the country&#8217;s top commercial paper holders. USDT has a market capitalization of $72 billion, according to Tether.</p>



<p>Stablecoins that do not bind liquidity, such as ones based on algorithms, are considered hazardous and less fungible.</p>



<p>Stablecoins may have the same challenges as private bank notes, which are not deemed fungible and need anyone handling them to determine whether to accept any given note at face value.</p>



<h2>Growth potential of stablecoins</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Inclusive of payment and finance systems</strong></li></ul>



<p>Stablecoins have the ability to drive payment system expansion and innovation, allowing for quicker and cheaper transactions. In addition, stablecoins may eliminate payment barriers and put pressure on existing payment systems to provide better services; since they can be used to transmit funds near-instantaneously peer-to-peer across digital wallets for potentially minimal costs.</p>



<p>Stablecoins may also contribute to a more accessible financial system by facilitating the emergence of DeFi, which is expected to necessitate stablecoins as a required component.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Tokenized financial markets</strong></li></ul>



<p>Stablecoins may also play an essential role in tokenizing financial markets. For example, transforming securities into digital tokens on DLTs and trading and servicing them using stablecoins would be required. In addition, a tokenized market would allow real-time settlement at meager costs for delivery-versus-payment (DvP) transactions, such as security purchases. This might improve liquidity, transaction speeds, and transparency while also lowering counterparty risk, trading costs, and other market entry hurdles.</p>



<p>Certain asset types, such as real estate, may gain the most from this, as it allows for fractional ownership of tokenized assets and more transparent price discovery.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Next-generation innovations</strong></li></ul>



<p>Finally, stablecoins have the potential to aid in the development of next-generation technologies. <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/why-web-3-0-matters/" data-wpel-link="internal">Web 3</a>, a projected shift away from centralized web platforms and data centers toward decentralized networks, is one example of such an innovation.</p>



<p>In addition, the emergence of effective, integrated online payment systems will enable Internet services and social media platforms to shift their revenue from adverts to microtransactions under this paradigm.</p>



<h2>What does it all mean?</h2>



<p>The robust use cases that are now driving the adoption of existing public and institutional stablecoins are supported by the defining qualities of stablecoins, their cryptographic security, and programmability. On the other hand, these characteristics have the potential to spur innovation beyond existing use cases, which are primarily limited to cryptocurrency exchanges, specific peer-to-peer payments, and institutional liquidity management by massive institutions.</p>



<p>In the future, stablecoin technologies might see multiple applications and promote innovation in several sectors, including more inclusive payment and financial systems, tokenized financial markets, and the facilitation of microtransactions for technical developments like Web 3.</p>



<h2>Final words</h2>



<p>Stablecoins have had tremendous popularity over the last year as digital assets become more widely accepted and the applications of programmable digital currencies become clearer. However, this fast rise has sparked fears that it would have severe consequences for banks and the existing financial system.</p>



<p>Finally, if they are believed to be appropriately collateralized, dollar-pegged stablecoins can serve as a safe haven relative to other crypto-assets during times of market turbulence.</p>

<p>AC Milan Fan Token (ACM) is one of 40 fan tokens of various international football clubs under Socios that enable fans of these clubs to have a stake in the clubs’ decision-making, earn VIP rewards and unlock access to exclusive promotions, games, chats as well as earning the chance to be recognised as a superfan. ACM is a utility token on the Chiliz Chain (built by Chiliz — a fintech blockchain company), a Proof-of-Authority sidechain built on Ethereum. Like the other fan tokens, AC Milan Fan Token gives AC Milan fans the power of influence in how the team operates, by voting on team polls which the teams have to take into consideration. Examples of changes that ACM holders can make include picking jersey designs, naming training venues, and picking the next fan event. ACM acts as a gateway to every AC Milan fan’s chance to show their loyalty and support for the team by earning reward points, getting VIP experiences and purchasing club merch. Like many other crypto platforms, the larger the number of tokens you have guarantees you a higher level of influence in the tokenbase.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve witnessed a considerable increase in complicated financial instruments in the market due to the recent emergence of the crypto business. Due to these recent developments, traders and investors have begun to use crypto derivatives. Let&#8217;s have a look at what they are.</p>



<h1>What are crypto derivatives?</h1>



<p>Contracts based on following an underlying asset are known as derivatives. Stocks, commodities, currencies, bonds, and other financial instruments are examples of these assets.</p>



<p>There isn&#8217;t much of a difference in the essential functionalities of crypto derivatives. Users track an underlying asset using crypto derivatives at or before the expiration date.</p>



<p>Derivatives, in general, have an <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/why-does-ethereum-have-an-intrinsic-value/" data-wpel-link="internal">intrinsic value</a> (this is the rate at which they are traded in the market). Traders and investors utilize crypto derivatives to protect themselves against the risks and returns connected with a particular asset. The market movements of these assets are determined by buyers&#8217; and sellers&#8217; assumptions about the future price of the underlying asset.</p>



<h1>What are the different types of crypto derivatives?</h1>



<ul><li><strong>Crypto futures</strong></li></ul>



<p>A futures contract involves a buyer and seller agreeing to sell an item in the future. The exact day and money are also agreed upon in advance. The specifics of the contract may differ, but the terms are typically the same.</p>



<p>Futures are a prominent sort of cryptocurrency derivative that institutional investors employ. Futures data is commonly used to forecast future price changes and market sentiment.</p>



<p>Depending on future price fluctuations, traders may profit or lose. For example, if Bitcoin is now trading at $40,000, an investor might purchase or sell futures contracts to anticipate a price drop or rise.</p>



<p>In any instance, if a buyer buys a one-Bit futures contract for $40,000 and the price rises to $60,000 by the time the contract expires, the buyer will have made a $20,000 profit. On the other hand, if the price lowers to $30,000 before the contract is completed, the buyer will have lost $10,000.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Crypto options</strong></li></ul>



<p>Another sort of derivative transaction is an option, which allows a trader to purchase or sell a particular commodity at a predetermined price at a later date. Unlike futures, however, options enable the buyer to choose whether or not to purchase the item.</p>



<p>There are call-and-put options, as well as American and European options, to choose from.</p>



<p>A trader can use call options to buy an asset on a specific date, while put options can be used to sell an item on the same day.</p>



<p>Furthermore, American options can be sold before the contract&#8217;s expiration date, but European options must be sold on the specified day.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Perpetual contracts</strong></li></ul>



<p>The most common crypto derivative, also known as a perpetual futures <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-are-smart-contracts-and-why-you-need-to-know-about-them/" data-wpel-link="internal">contract </a>or perpetual swap, is the perpetual contract, popular among day traders. In classical finance, a contract for difference would be equal to a perpetual contract.</p>



<p>The primary distinction between perpetual contracts and futures and options is that perpetual contracts have no expiration date. Positions can be held for as long as the trader desires as long as they pay the funding rate, which is a price for holding them. A minimal amount, known as the margin, must also be included in the account.</p>



<p>Because underlying assets fluctuate in value, the spread between the index price and the price of perpetual futures contracts is sometimes significant. If the perpetual contract&#8217;s price is greater than the index, investors who want to &#8220;go long&#8221; would generally pay the funding rate to make up the difference.</p>



<p>Similarly, if the perpetual futures contract price is lower than the index price, those who choose to &#8220;go short&#8221; will pay the funding rate to cover the price difference.</p>



<h1>What are the advantages of crypto derivatives?</h1>



<ul><li><strong>Low transaction costs:</strong> Derivative contracts assist in minimizing market transaction costs since they are risk management instruments. As a result, the cost of transactions in derivatives trading is lower than in other securities such as spot trading.</li><li><strong>Market efficiency:</strong> Derivative trading involves arbitrage, which is essential for ensuring that the market achieves equilibrium and that the prices of the underlying assets are correct.</li><li><strong>Determines an underlying asset&#8217;s price: </strong>Derivative contracts are widely used to ascertain an underlying asset&#8217;s price.</li><li><strong>The risk may be transferred:</strong> Derivatives allow investors, organizations, and other parties to transfer risk to others.</li></ul>



<h1>What are the disadvantages of crypto derivatives?</h1>



<ul><li><strong>High risk:</strong> Due to the rapid change in the value of the underlying crypto coins/tokens, derivative contracts are very volatile. As a result, traders risk losing a significant amount of money.</li><li><strong>Speculative:</strong> Derivative contracts are commonly used as speculative instruments. Speculative investments can result in substantial losses due to the high risk involved and the unpredictability of their value fluctuations.</li></ul>



<h1>Final words</h1>



<p>Crypto derivatives trading is a fantastic choice for both new and experienced crypto investors. You can choose from the numerous varieties covered in this article, but your investment should be entirely on your risk tolerance.</p>

<p>While the global crypto markets have been recording staggering growth to over 21,000% since 2016, the ride hasn’t been very smooth. Besides the inherent volatility and uncertainty prevalent in the market, the cryptocurrency market has been at the receiving end of some notorious crypto hacks and cybersecurity breaches. While all these hacks were one of their kind, there was something to learn from each one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s discuss the top 5 crypto hacks from which the exchanges and traders can learn their lessons and recognize the responsibility attached to handling millions of dollars worth of crypto assets:&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tma50eSjJePIproasiXUUm3_dDLGGRq61cq0vSjs9vA_Kgi_XiAJnaz1vQ8J8msiuwkmZ1DBt-xtZ75DhuCS7hJxX4Oa1inrY6r38Ke9jDpdMVfezFrgSmXhlflasAdZRqkS4wqD1VEk1gmh" alt=""/></figure>



<h2>The Ronin Network Crypto Heist, March 2022</h2>



<p>The $625 million worth of crypto hack on the Ronin network &#8211; home to Axie Infinity &#8211; is the most recent and the largest exploit in the history of cryptocurrency networks. The gaming-focused network announced the loss of <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/03/29/axie-infinitys-ronin-network-suffers-625m-exploit/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">173,600 ether and 25.5 million USDC</a> valued hundreds and millions of dollars in the exploit.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How did it happen?</strong></p>



<p>Ronin sidechain has nine validators deployed on its chain and requires five signatures for withdrawals. The security arrangement is in place to protect the blockchain against these attacks. But the attacker used a backdoor entry through Ronin’s gas-free RPC node. The node was abused to obtain the signature for the Axie DAO validator.&nbsp; As seen on Etherscan, the attacker used hacked private keys to forge fake withdrawals from the Ronin Bridge across two transactions. The exploit impacted the validator nodes for Sky Mavis, which is responsible for publishing the Axie Infinity game and Axie DAO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The address used in this attack was a new address that had transferred ETH from the Binance exchange one week prior to the attack. Except for the 6,250 ETH transferred to various other addresses, most of the loot remains in the attacker&#8217;s address. The Ronin network and Katana AMM have been paused until the investigations continue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>The Poly Network Hack, August 2021</h2>



<p>Another of the biggest and most recent crypto hacks is the Poly Network hack. On August 10, 2021, around $611 million worth of crypto assets were stolen from Poly Network &#8211; a smart contract platform where users can exchange tokens between blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How did it happen?</strong></p>



<p>The attacker found a way to surpass PolyNetwork’s security and buy tokens without selling the corresponding tokens on other blockchains. The hacker returned the assets within a week, except for $33 million worth of USDT, as they had been frozen immediately post the attack. The attacker supposedly said the hack was for ‘fun.’ But the hack disclosed the weaknesses of the current Defi systems, and experts realized there were lessons that needed to be learned to strengthen the security of the Defi ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>The CoinCheck Hack, January 2018</h2>



<p>The $547 million hacks happened in January 2018 when hackers breached Coincheck Inc. exchange’s system and stole hundreds of millions of worth of NEM tokens. Coincheck Inc. confirmed a security lapse but denied that it was an insider’s job.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How did it happen?</strong></p>



<p>Usually, exchanges keep customers’ crypto assets in cold wallets that aren’t connected to external networks, but Coincheck kept customer assets in hot wallets, which are vulnerable to outside attacks. Also, the exchange did not have multi-signature as an additional layer of wallet security.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 11 addresses to which the stolen NEM tokens went were identified, but it could not be identified to whom these addresses belonged. Each address has been labeled with the tag _accept_trades: owner_of_this_account_is_hacker. The developers of the NEM protocol developed a tracking tool that would help exchanges reject any trades concerning these stolen funds.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Mt. Gox Crypto Heist, February 2014</h2>



<p>This crypto hack was the most widely publicized attack on a Japanese exchange, Mt. Gox. The heist ran up to $480 million in value, all in Bitcoin. Over 8,50,000 bitcoins were stolen or considered lost &#8211; this number amounted to 7% of the total bitcoins in circulation. Their valuation would be in billions today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How did it happen?</strong></p>



<p>The exchange was set up in 2010 as a site for trading ‘Magic the Gathering’ game cards. By 2014 the exchange was handling 70% of the Bitcoin transactions. In February 2014, the exchange suspended its operations abruptly, closed its services, and filed for bankruptcy. Despite years of investigation, the culprit couldn’t be tracked, and it was concluded that the Mt. Gox hack had been an outsider&#8217;s job.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>KuCoin Crypto Hack, September 2020&nbsp;</h2>



<p>KuCoin exchange, headquartered in Singapore, became a victim of a $275 million cryptocurrency hack in September 2020. The theft involved $127 million worth of ERC20 tokens used in the Ethereum smart contracts.</p>



<p><strong>How did it happen?</strong></p>



<p>This hack was another incident where the exchange’s slack security mechanisms were, in a way, responsible for the theft.&nbsp; The hackers were able to initiate the attack by getting access to the private keys of the hot wallets belonging to the exchange. Later on, most of the funds were recovered, including 15% of the stolen funds covered under KuCoin’s insurance. None of the customers lost their assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While cyber security will always remain an issue, there are certain ways via which you, as a trader, can ensure the security of your assets. Choosing a trusted crypto exchange like WazirX is the first step in this regard. Check that the exchange’s security mechanisms, including multi-signature wallets, two-way authentication, KYC checks, and other AML procedures, are in place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, ensure that the exchange doesn’t use hot wallet systems to store its customers&#8217; funds. As a precautionary measure, if you aren’t actively trading your crypto assets, move them to an offline wallet or a hardware wallet to keep them safe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Never share your private keys with anyone. Check the authenticity of the project in which you are investing your funds. In simple funds, invest in those crypto projects that have been thoroughly audited. And lastly, make sure the exchange from where you are facilitating your crypto trades has insurance to cover the losses in case of a hack or cyber attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Head over to WazirX for a safe and seamless trading experience!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bitcoin derivatives are actually tradable securities or contracts with underlying assets as their source of value (Bitcoin spot rate). Due to rising interest among the crypto trading community, Bitcoin Futures and Options are currently among the most prevalent financial instruments on any cryptocurrency exchange or trading platform. Swaps, Futures, Forwards, Options, and Perpetual Futures are some of the Bitcoin derivatives available.</p>



<p>This blog will discuss Bitcoin, bitcoin futures, and important points to consider for trading bitcoin futures. Along with bitcoin futures explained in simple terms and its advantages.</p>



<h1>Bitcoin: A quick introduction</h1>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/bitcoin-risk-vs-reward/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a> is a type of digital cash, sometimes known as a cryptocurrency, produced or mined online by users solving challenging arithmetic challenges. These bitcoins are afterward stored in a digital wallet on the user&#8217;s computer or in the cloud.</p>



<p>The price of virtual currencies, like bitcoin, is highly volatile. As a result, the value of your virtual currency futures contract and the possible profit and losses associated with it will be affected by fluctuations in the underlying virtual currency&#8217;s value between the time you initiate a transaction and the time you seek to liquidate it. Therefore, investors must exercise extreme caution and keep a close eye on their investments.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s have a look at what are bitcoin futures?</p>



<h1>What are bitcoin futures?</h1>



<p>Bitcoin futures are a sort of derivative trading instrument. Two parties admit to trading bitcoin at a predetermined price at a future date, usually on a commodities market. Any trading agreement that tracks the price of an underlying asset is referred to as a derivative.</p>



<p>In essence, you commit to purchase or sell bitcoin at a given price on a specific date, regardless of market conditions. The contract settlement date is the agreed-upon date by which both parties must satisfy their commitments.</p>



<p>When a bitcoin futures contract ends, whoever committed to acquiring bitcoin must do so at a premium or a discount (since it&#8217;s extremely doubtful that bitcoin would be the exact price when the contract ends as it was when it was negotiated). The amount that an individual must pay is defined by the current market price (frequently known as the spot price) and the price of each futures contract in their ownership.</p>



<h1>Important points to consider</h1>



<ul><li>It&#8217;s worth noting that each contract has two sides. If one individual makes a profit, there is an investor who loses money on the opposite side.</li><li>Futures contracts always have an expiration date. Investors have the option of selling their contracts to another party before they expire or waiting until they expire to settle them.</li><li>The pricing of <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/spot-trading-vs-futures-trading-in-crypto/" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin futures</a> and the market price of bitcoin tend to fluctuate based on the current settlement of futures traders. The contract&#8217;s value will usually be higher than bitcoin&#8217;s current market price if more people are betting on it growing. The scenario is reversed when more traders expect that the price of bitcoin will fall in the future. The bitcoin futures contracts&#8217; prices and bitcoin on spot markets tend to converge as contract expiry dates approach.</li></ul>



<h1>Bitcoin futures explained in simple language.</h1>



<p>Let&#8217;s use the following example as an example:</p>



<ul><li>Assume you wish to speculate on gold&#8217;s price. You may go out and buy gold bars in person and then sell them when the price rises.</li><li>However, because you&#8217;d have to factor in storage and transit costs, this is virtually unfeasible and expensive. Instead, a better strategy would be to trade an instrument or contract linked to gold&#8217;s price.</li><li>These are agreements that assist you in signing with an opposing party. It also helps you think that you feel the price will rise while someone else believes it will fall.</li><li>You and another speculator can sign an agreement stating that if the price moves in either direction after a specified time, one side must pay the other the price difference.</li><li>For example, suppose the price of BTC is $1000, and you expect it to climb. It&#8217;ll go down, your counterparty predicts. However, by the time you need to settle the contract, the price has risen to $11,00. The opposing trader will pay only the difference of $1,00.</li><li>Assume the situation is reversed, and the price drops to $900; you will be required to pay $1,00. As you can see, an investor or trader can earn even when prices fall without needing to hold the underlying asset in such an agreement or contract.</li><li>Though this is how derivatives function in the trading world, there are numerous variances in reality. Futures and settlement options, and perpetual contracts are the most extensively used derivatives in the bitcoin sector.</li></ul>



<h1>Advantages of trading bitcoin futures</h1>



<ul><li><strong>Flexibility</strong></li></ul>



<p>Bitcoin Futures give non-Bitcoin holders the ability to speculate on the price of Bitcoin and earn quickly. For example, you may use USDT to open a position in a Bitcoin futures contract, and any winnings will be paid out in USDT.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Leverage</strong></li></ul>



<p>Bitcoin futures contracts allow you to have a lot of exposure to Bitcoin for a fraction of the price. As a result, you may use leverage to magnify relatively tiny price fluctuations and turn them into profits worth your time and efforts.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Liquidity</strong></li></ul>



<p>With billions of dollars in monthly turnover, bitcoin futures are one of the most liquid markets in the crypto economy. Because there is always someone eager to take the opposing side of a particular position, a liquid market is often linked with lower risk, and traders will experience less slippage.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Portfolio Diversification</strong></li></ul>



<p>Bitcoin futures provide you with additional ways to diversify your trading tactics and increase your earnings. Short-selling, arbitrage, pairs trading, and other complex trading tactics are now available to traders.</p>



<h1>Final thoughts</h1>



<p>Bitcoin accounts for a sizable piece of the rapidly expanding digital asset industry. Bitcoin futures offer investors transparency, price discovery, and risk management skills. In addition, individual market players will be able to access the bitcoin market and hedge any direct exposure to bitcoin prices through the contract.</p>

<p>Meme coins are joke tokens quite popular in the cryptocurrency world. These tokens carry no fundamentals or utility and derive traction from the meme&#8217;s popularity on which they are based and the community&#8217;s support. Often these meme coins are mere pump and dump schemes where the hype around a coin is created first, and then the coins are dumped in the market. One such coin was the Squid Game crypto. Let’s learn more about the meme coin and the controversy surrounding it. </p>



<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/LszoPzMdHLyO6YjK-aFBMuXKTyvCETTsb5oQ1lhj1aK68L500u2wnOh2j2HyxNoYN3hdmjG7SBnqDYCZo7wIFAjOwgF2MU9Jkk4B6w_gczqXcC6cFavH5Osbeo3TTFcRapzpIIRTJUwceMkI" width="624" height="269"></p>



<h2>The Story behind Squid Game Cryptocurrency</h2>



<p>The Squid Games crypto, better known as the ‘Squid Token’, was a cryptocurrency developed by someone that, to this date, remains anonymous. They followed almost the same pattern as actual games. First, you would have to participate in a presale, and the ten most expensive placeholders would get validated and they will go to the next level. Then there would be games that the placeholders would play, and whoever won any of the top three positions would gain points; in the end, the three placeholders with the highest point valuation would win and split the prize money.</p>



<p>This cryptocurrency was created to take advantage of the popularity of the South Korean drama series by the same name.&nbsp; The project was well-received by the masses and garnered a lot of success. The coin even reached <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/squid-game/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">$2,86 1 at one time</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Later on, though, the coin proved to be a rug pull scam. When its valuation dropped to $0, the creators of the token had taken advantage of the show&#8217;s hype. And when the coin reached a certain value, they quickly exchanged the profits from crypto for real-life money. This was done by using a website called Tornado Cash, which privatizes your transactions on the blockchain, effectively hiding whatever you do to the funds on the blockchain. They fled with all of the profit worth <a href="https://thelogicalindian.com/technology/squid-coin-32078#:~:text=Squid%20Coin%3A%20A%20Crypto%20Scam%20That%20Robbed%20Investors%20Off%20%243.38%20Million,-Writer%3A%20Pathik%20Muni" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">$3.38million</a> while investors were left reeling under the losses.</p>



<h2>What exactly happened with Squid Games Crypto?</h2>



<p>The Squid Game Crypto quickly rose to popularity and had more than <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/squid-game-cryptocurrency-rug-pull-scam/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">40,000 tokenholders</a>. The website which the scammers set up for Squid Games Crypto had guidelines and regulations and seemed legit for the most part. The whitepaper even stated that &#8220;Liquidity (shares) of SQUID will be locked for a minimum of three years on DxSale, preventing any unseen and immediate changes to SQUID liquidity pool. Unlock date is set for 20th October 2024.&#8221; The creators even had social media accounts where the Squid Games Crypto was heavily promoted.</p>



<p>Even though it seemed to be legit, there were warnings by many as there was no apparent verification from the creators of the show or Netflix that the &#8216;Squid Token&#8217; was made in collaboration with them. The website that did not seem suspicious for the most part also presented minor red flags with the way the content that was presented on the website was filled with spelling errors.</p>



<p>Another thing that should have been seen as a top-off for potential buyers was the fact that it might have been easy to purchase the squid game crypto but to sell it, it was a mandatory requirement that you would have to purchase another token called &#8216;Marbles.&#8217; The process of selling was much harder and made almost impossible in comparison to buying it.</p>



<p>Of course, all of this still did not stop many investors from purchasing the &#8216;Squid Token&#8217; and taking part in the whole process set up by the creators. Everything seemed good until one day, suddenly, the value was at $2,861, and the very next, it dropped down to $0. The creators had scammed everyone by cashing out the cryptocurrency for real-life money and had managed to get away with one of the most major scams in the crypto world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Blockchain exists so that third parties are not involved, and the seller can connect directly to the buyer and vice versa. This extra step that was put in place, asking sellers to invest in another crypto before selling the &#8216;Squid Token,&#8217; is pretty uncommon and should have acted as a fair warning to everyone buying or selling the Squid Games Crypto.</p>



<h2>Why did the scam happen in the first place?</h2>



<p>This is not the first instance where scammers have taken advantage of the blockchain&#8217;s anonymity. The Squid Game Crypto is just one of the many rug pull scams where creators of false crypto have taken advantage of popular shows and movies and made millions of dollars, stolen them all, and gone without facing any actual consequences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8216;The Mandalorian&#8217;, a popular show made in connection with the Star Wars Franchise, gained popularity just like &#8216;Squid Games&#8217; and faced something similar. The scammers made a cryptocurrency called &#8216;Mando&#8217; and used images from the show without legal permission from the creators or Disney+, where the show aired. They used the show&#8217;s popularity and created the crypto at the peak of the show’s rise to success.</p>



<p>Clever tricks like this are always used to attract potential buyers under the guise that they are investing in something connected to a show or a movie. Media &#8211; whether print or visual &#8211; should also make it a point not to promote such projects that have shown signs of a scam. Instead, they should warn people to be wary of such projects.</p>



<p>You should always be careful when purchasing and selling cryptocurrencies and ensure that whatever you are spending and investing your money in is verified and provides you with active profit. The anonymity can act as an asset and a con for everyone dealing in the crypto business, so all need to be actively aware of whatever they invest in.</p>

<p>Since Facebook thought to rebrand itself to Meta in October 2021, with the announcement of the sale of 10 million Oculus VR devices, the word &#8220;metaverse&#8221; has been widely interpreted to imply &#8220;using the Internet in virtual reality.&#8221; This is a blunder.</p>



<p>Although others believe it will not be the most essential, virtual reality (VR headsets) will be one of several methods to enter the metaverse. Between the metaverse and virtual reality, there are several distinctions to be found. This blog will make you understand the difference between metaverse and virtual reality with a full review of both technologies.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s get this party started.</p>



<h1>What is a metaverse?</h1>



<p>A metaverse is a 3D cosmos that exists indefinitely and has an online presence that connects multiple virtual locations. Consider it as a more sophisticated version of the Internet. Thanks to the metaverse, users will be able to cooperate, socialize, play, and engage in these 3D spaces.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/the-metaverse-craze/" data-wpel-link="internal">metaverse</a> is a three-dimensional virtual environment that allows users to explore and engage with virtual locations, content, and services. Surprisingly, the metaverse enables diverse users to create virtual environments and solutions, developing a creative economy.</p>



<p>Virtual reality and other technologies, such as AR glasses, can be used to enter the metaverse. You may also access the metaverse using your computer or smartphone.</p>



<h1>What is virtual reality?</h1>



<p>As the name indicates, virtual reality (VR) refers to the construction of virtual worlds aided by technology. Virtual reality is a three-dimensional world created by computers from a technological standpoint. In an immersive and engaging environment, a person might explore the virtual reality experience and interact with it.</p>



<p>In VR settings, users are engaged in the environments and may handle items or do various activities. Using customized headgear and glasses connected to the machine executing the applications, users might engage in unique VR experiences. The specialized gadgets enhance users&#8217; immersive experiences with sensory aspects in the virtual world, including sight and sound.</p>



<p>So, this was just an overview of what is metaverse and virtual reality. Let&#8217;s quickly jump to the key differences between them.</p>



<h1>Metaverse Vs. Virtual Reality</h1>



<ol><li><strong>Definition</strong></li></ol>



<p>The metaverse is a type of virtual world that is open, shared, and persistent, allowing users to access 3D virtual places, solutions, and surroundings. On the other hand, virtual reality is a technique for constructing three-dimensional virtual worlds with specialized functionality.</p>



<p>However, it is vital to highlight that the metaverse has no specific definition. As a result, in the discussion between virtual reality and the metaverse, VR has the upper hand in the definition.</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Ownership</strong></li></ol>



<p>The second significant distinction between the metaverse and virtual reality is the possibility of ownership. When you work on a VR system, you are essentially experiencing a system that a company owns. The brand holds the content used in the system&#8217;s virtual reality experiences. The only thing you have in your possession with VR technology is the equipment.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the metaverse is an entirely different ballgame in that it allows people to own virtual goods. Whether it&#8217;s a piece of physical real estate or an artifact, everything you make and possess in the metaverse is yours. Users have complete ownership privileges in the metaverse.</p>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Technology limitations</strong></li></ol>



<p>When it comes to virtual reality, there are specific technological constraints. However, with advancements in VR technologies, you can only build more sophisticated virtual experiences. In the end, virtual reality would be all about simulations and having fun with virtual worlds.</p>



<p>The metaverse, on the other hand, has no such restrictions. It isn&#8217;t only reliant on virtual reality technologies for its power. Many additional technologies, including augmented reality, blockchain, cryptocurrency, and connection technologies, propel the metaverse&#8217;s features.</p>



<ol start="4"><li><strong>Experiences</strong></li></ol>



<p>The way you interact with virtual reality and the metaverse is an equally essential consideration. For example, in the case of virtual reality, you may imagine yourself wearing a headset or other device that allows you to interact with the virtual environment.</p>



<p>By merging AR and VR technology, the metaverse creates a virtual reality comparable to the actual world. As a result, you may move about in virtual environments as if you were in the real world, although as a digital avatar.</p>



<p>Want to read about the top best Metaverse games to play in 2022, <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/5-best-metaverse-games-to-play-in-2022/" data-wpel-link="internal">click here</a>.</p>



<ol start="5"><li><strong>Persistence</strong></li></ol>



<p>Persistence is the next point of distinction between the metaverse and virtual reality. Thanks to VR technology, the metaverse is still in progress, but you can already encounter virtual worlds. The experiences with VR systems, on the other hand, end when the machine is turned off.</p>



<p>Because it is a shared and enduring environment, the metaverse flips the script on VR in terms of permanence. This means that your digital avatar will remain in the metaverse even if you leave it. Other users would engage and interact with the metaverse, running normally.</p>



<h1>Bottom line</h1>



<p>The most recent contrast in a metaverse versus virtual reality debate shows that the metaverse is more than simply VR. One of the core technologies for Metaverse development is virtual reality. It allows individuals to enter the metaverse. However, VR can only perform a limited number of tasks.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the metaverse is a vast and ever-changing virtual world that incorporates a three-dimensional representation of the Internet. Users may move around virtual 3D areas in the metaverse as they would on a web page. Above all, the possibilities for bringing innovation to the metaverse are endless. Begin to discover more about the metaverse and how virtual reality may assist it.</p>

Here is why and how!

                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1621" height="1081" src="https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Blog-What-does-being-bullish-and-bearish-mean.jpg" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="Why you shouldn’t be scared of a Bear Market" loading="lazy" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;" link_thumbnail="" srcset="https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Blog-What-does-being-bullish-and-bearish-mean.jpg 1621w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Blog-What-does-being-bullish-and-bearish-mean-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Blog-What-does-being-bullish-and-bearish-mean-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Blog-What-does-being-bullish-and-bearish-mean-768x512.jpg 768w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Blog-What-does-being-bullish-and-bearish-mean-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Blog-What-does-being-bullish-and-bearish-mean-900x600.jpg 900w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Blog-What-does-being-bullish-and-bearish-mean-174x116.jpg 174w" sizes="(max-width: 1621px) 100vw, 1621px" /><div id="bsf_rt_marker">
<p>What happens when you sell your Cryptocurrencies for a profit at their respective all-time highs price during a bull market? You rejoice and celebrate as a result of the fact that you made some hefty profits. However, on the contrary, what you don&#8217;t think of is the buyer on the other end of your trade that bought the all-time high. While you celebrate, what should the buyer do? Should he panic about buying the top? That&#8217;s hardly the case.</p>



<p>Perhaps at one point, you were in the same standing as the buyer when you bought into your position. You might have bought the 2017 top without your knowledge, but you managed to sell it for a profit during the bull run that followed. What we can infer from this scenario is that while the present conditions might be rough, if you are patient and disciplined enough, you&#8217;ll definitely make it.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s startling is how many individuals are complaining about losing money on cryptocurrency in recent weeks. If you made some risky decisions or succumbed to FOMO and staked the house on it, you&#8217;ll have to accept responsibility. Bear markets are not a new phenomenon. Bitcoin has collapsed multiple times in the past, as is well known. The old adage &#8220;it&#8217;s not about timing the market, it&#8217;s about how much time you spend in the market&#8221; applies equally to cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>So, looking at the past several days, it may appear to be a crash. But if you go back far enough, cryptocurrencies are still on the rise.</p>



<h2><strong>This is not the first and not the worst Bear Market</strong></h2>



<p>Bear markets are an unavoidable element of every economic cycle; every period of repeated highs is inevitably followed by a period of fall, no matter how brief or lengthy.</p>



<h3><strong>99% in June 2011</strong></h3>



<p>Bitcoin skyrocketed from $2 to more than $32 in 2011, reaching parity with an ounce of silver. Then the bottom fell out. Mt. Gox, the world&#8217;s largest Bitcoin exchange, admitted on June 19 that hackers had accessed several accounts and stolen millions of dollars in Bitcoins. In just one day, the value of a Bitcoin dropped to one cent.</p>



<h3><strong>56% in August 2012</strong></h3>



<p>In August 2012, the community found out that a traditional Ponzi scam modified for the digital age had been defrauding cryptocurrency investors for months. The perpetrator — ultimately accused, convicted, fined, and imprisoned — had taken 700,000 Bitcoins by fraud, promising amazing profits of 7 percent monthly interest.</p>



<h3><strong>83% in April 2013</strong></h3>



<p>Bitcoin became a victim of its own success in 2013, as investors raced on to the exciting new prospect that was spreading in the mainstream media. Trading traffic was so high that Mt. Gox couldn&#8217;t keep up, and when it crashed, hackers took advantage of the vulnerability. It led Mt. Gox into an unprecedented complete closure, with prices plummeting from roughly $260 to $50.</p>



<h3><strong>50% in December 2013</strong></h3>



<p>According to the Guardian, when China banned Bitcoin at the end of 2013, its value dropped by half overnight. China&#8217;s relationship with cryptocurrencies remains unstable, with the authorities implementing new restrictions on a regular basis.</p>



<h3><strong>84% between December 2017 and December 2018</strong></h3>



<p>In 2017, Bitcoin had a historic year, shattering all of its own records and reaching a high of $20,000. Then, on December 27, everything fell apart as speculators cashed in on what was clearly a bubble, bringing the price below $12,000. The cryptocurrency would continue to fall throughout 2018, as major hacks in Korea and Japan, as well as rumors that both countries were preparing to outlaw Bitcoin, led already apprehensive investors to flee.</p>



<h3><strong>50% in March 2020</strong></h3>



<p>Bitcoin was not spared by the epidemic, and when the markets plummeted in March 2020, the Bitcoin market crashed even more. Bitcoin&#8217;s value fell by 50% in just 2 days. Over the course of a month, it dropped from above $10,000 in February to below $4,000 in March.</p>



<h3><strong>53% in May 2021</strong></h3>



<p>In April, one Bitcoin was worth almost $64,000. Then, in one week, $1 trillion was wiped out of the crypto market. Major hacks in Korea and Japan, as well as speculations that both governments were preparing to outlaw Bitcoin, led investors to quit. First, Elon Musk abandoned his commitment to accept Bitcoin as payment for Tesla vehicles. Then China announced another cryptocurrency crackdown. Finally, the public became aware of the environmental effect of Bitcoin mining, leaving crypto investors in a familiar situation – at the mercy of factors beyond their control.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While many new investors fear a potential bear market, those who have seen multiple market cycles and have some expertise under their belts are bracing for a buying frenzy. And, contrary to popular belief, bear markets typically provide some of the finest buying opportunities.</p>



<p>Cryptocurrency markets are typically volatile, which works both for and against investors. They are also significantly influenced by waves of FUD and FOMO, which can cause unpredictable price swings, times of cascading loss, and moments of stratospheric growth.</p>



<p>This creates possibilities for savvy traders who can recognize and exploit trends in market structure, as well as benefit from the often predictable market volatility caused by changes in supply and demand.</p>



<p>However, bear markets can be frightening for rookie traders. After all, no one enjoys the prospect of possibly significant losses on investments, even if these losses are frequently temporary if the investment survives the bearish period.</p>



<h2><strong>Reasons to be Bullish in Bearish times</strong></h2>



<p>The cryptocurrency market seems to be rebounding after a challenging few months. Once the worst is over, there are numerous reasons to be optimistic about crypto.</p>



<h3><strong>Significant Growth Prospects</strong></h3>



<p>While cryptocurrencies are frequently discussed in the mainstream media, the reality is that most cryptocurrencies are more than just digital money contending with fiat.</p>



<p>Unlike traditional money, they not only represent the expansion of the blockchain ecosystem that supports them, but they also provide control over them in a manner comparable to stock, as well as a number of features, security, and currencies that Fiat simply cannot offer.</p>



<h3><strong>Major Networks are Getting Major Updates</strong></h3>



<p>Some of the industry&#8217;s most important projects, including Cardano, Polkadot, and Solana, are set for an upgrade in the near future. These enhancements, which are set to be released this year, are intended to boost adoption.</p>



<p>Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain network, is currently working on Ethereum 2.0, a major network update.</p>



<h3><strong>Concerns about the environment are being addressed</strong></h3>



<p>Concerns about the environmental effect of mining have been a big source of pain for the crypto sector in recent years. With Ethereum moving to a proof-of-stake consensus and organizations like the Bitcoin Mining Council forming, sustainable crypto mining appears to be on the horizon.</p>



<h3><strong>The popularity of NFT is rising</strong></h3>



<p>Non-Fungible Tokens have been an important component of pop culture in recent years, as celebrities and organizations have begun to join the ecosystem. Marvel Comics and Fortune magazine were among the most recent to reveal NFT collections, with British auction house Christie&#8217;s also expressing an increased interest in the technology.</p>



<h3><strong>Crypto Has the Support of Regulators</strong></h3>



<p>Despite a last-minute attempt to modify the Infrastructure Bill submitted to the United States Senate, the cryptocurrency industry received widespread support from politicians in the United States. In India, regulators went ahead to implement a tax slab for cryptocurrencies, with sources claiming that a bill that aims to regulate cryptocurrencies is underway. All of this goes to demonstrate how regulators all across the globe have softened their stance regarding cryptocurrencies.</p>



<h3><strong>Institutional Support is on the rise</strong></h3>



<p>Despite the concerns, the cryptocurrency and blockchain sector is expanding. Much-needed financial architecture is being developed, and institutional-grade custodial services are becoming more accessible to investors. Professional and individual investors are progressively gaining access to the tools they need to manage and protect their crypto holdings.</p>



<p>Crypto futures markets are emerging, and many institutions are gaining direct exposure to the cryptocurrency market. Block and PayPal are making it simpler to buy and trade cryptocurrencies on their popular platforms. Other firms, including Block, have invested billions of dollars in Bitcoin and other digital assets. In early 2021, Tesla acquired $1.5 billion in Bitcoin. By February 2022, the electric car manufacturer claimed holding about $2 billion in bitcoin. Since 2020, MicroStrategy, a business intelligence software firm, has been acquiring Bitcoin. By the end of 2021, it had $5.7 billion in cryptocurrencies and stated that it intends to buy more with extra revenue earned from operations. This trend has continued this year as well.</p>



<p>Although multiple parameters continue to influence the volatility of cryptocurrencies, the growing rate of adoption is a symptom of an industry maturing. Both investors and corporations are seeking direct exposure to cryptocurrencies, believing it to be safe enough to invest large amounts of funds.</p>



<h2><strong>Take this time out to Strategize</strong></h2>



<p>By now, you must have gotten the idea that bear markets are part of the market cycle and will eventually come to an end. Hence, such volatile periods are a good time to reflect upon your trading strategies and prepare for the upcoming bull run.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Study why the market is dropping</strong></h3>



<p>You should know why prices are falling in case it affects your investing strategy. If your rationale for investing remains valid, it is fine. But if something has radically changed, such as a security incident, and you no longer trust a certain project, it&#8217;s a different issue.</p>



<p>Assume you purchased a cryptocurrency because you believe the underlying blockchain technology would transform a certain sector. Rumors that quantum computing breakthroughs have rendered that technology obsolete cause the price to plummet. If such reports are true, it may be time to reconsider your investment; your rationale may no longer be valid.</p>



<h3><strong>Don&#8217;t panic-sell</strong></h3>



<p>When the value of your cryptocurrency investments falls, it is normal to want to reduce your losses and sell your holdings. However, this frequently means that you sell at a low and miss out on any subsequent rebound.</p>



<p>Assume you notice the price of Bitcoin declined by 20% and decide to sell your holdings. What if the price suddenly returns to its former level? You&#8217;ve lost 20% and may be hesitant to buy it back.</p>



<p>In the short term, you never know what prices will do. They may continue to plummet, but they may also rapidly rise. So believe in your original research and investing concept. If you believe in the long-term potential of your cryptocurrency investment, you should be optimistic that the price will rebound.</p>



<h3><strong>Consider buying the dip</strong></h3>



<p>People speak a lot about buying at lows and selling at highs, but it&#8217;s almost impossible to time the market in this way. That&#8217;s one reason why many opt for a long-term investing strategy: if you only acquire assets that you believe will do well in the next five to ten years, short-term price changes are less of a concern.</p>



<p>On the other hand, significant dips may give an opportunity to acquire more of your preferred tokens at a low price. For example, you may have had tokens on your watchlist for some time and were waiting for the appropriate time to buy them. You could also want to acquire more of the particular tokens you already hold if you believe they have significant long-term potential.</p>



<p>However, don&#8217;t fall into the trap of panic buying. It&#8217;s pointless to buy something you haven&#8217;t researched and don&#8217;t actually desire just because it&#8217;s on sale. It&#8217;s also not a smart idea to spend the money you need to fulfill other financial goals (or, worse, borrow money) to buy the dip. Crypto investments remain unpredictable, and there are many unknowns, particularly as the possibility of greater regulation looms. You may try to buy the dip only to see prices drop even further.</p>



<h2><strong>Closing note</strong></h2>



<p>Keep in mind that cryptocurrency markets typically transfer funds from the impatient to the patient. Those who abandon their positions early or on a hunch will, on average, lose against those who utilize a well-thought-out and long-term focused trading approach. Bear markets magnify this disparity, benefiting those who have a strategy while penalizing those who don&#8217;t. So long story short, if you are well prepared and don&#8217;t panic, bear markets should be more of an opportunity rather than a problem.</p>

<p>Crypto Liquidity Pools (CLPs) are a critical component of the DeFi ecosystem. A pool of tokens or digital assets is a collection of tokens or digital assets kept in a smart contract. These pools assist in promoting decentralized trade and lower the risk of washout, among other reasons.</p>



<p>Liquidity pools are said to be the core of the present DeFi ecosystem. Yield farming, Automated Market Maker (AMM), on-chain protection, lend-borrow protocols, blockchain gaming, and other applications rely on them.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s take a closer look at the notion of crypto liquidity pools.</p>



<h1>Crypto liquidity pools: An introduction</h1>



<p>Liquidity for DEX, lending and borrowing protocols, and other DeFi applications is provided by crypto liquidity pools, which are a collection of funds placed in a smart contract.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-problems-can-defi-solve/" data-wpel-link="internal">Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</a> marketplaces, a liquidity pool provides market liquidity to crypto traders and investors.</p>



<p>A crypto liquidity pool may be a decentralized alternative to a smart contract-powered order book or matching engine.</p>



<h1>The mechanism behind the crypto liquidity pools</h1>



<p>Liquidity in cryptocurrency refers to the simplicity with which you may convert your cryptocurrency to fiat cash or any other asset without impacting its price. This means you may change your bitcoin or another crypto asset to a good cash value right now. Let&#8217;s look at how this works:</p>



<ul><li>A liquidity pool is made up of two tokens or cryptocurrencies. Pools create numerous marketplaces for a pair of tokens.</li><li>The pool&#8217;s creator establishes each asset&#8217;s initial price. On the other hand, the liquidity provider risks losing money if the pool&#8217;s price does not match that of the global crypto market.</li><li>Keeping tokens in line with the market price is vital as more suppliers contribute cash to the pool.</li><li>Since the liquidity pool allows token swaps, the pricing algorithm is in charge of altering the asset price. Each liquidity pool might compute the value using its approach.</li><li>The algorithm guarantees that the pool is constantly liquid, regardless of the size of the deal, and is called Automated Market Makers (AMMs).</li><li>The token ratio determines the pool&#8217;s price. When somebody buys DAI from the DAI/ETH pool, for example, the volume of ETH grows, rising DAI&#8217;s price while reducing ETH&#8217;s.</li><li>The final price adjustment will be determined by the amount paid and the extent to which the pool was adjusted.</li><li>Larger pools have fewer variations since big trades and purchases are necessary for changes to occur.</li><li>The liquidity providers are compensated by the transaction fees others pay to purchase and sell from the pool. Those transaction fees are re-invested in the liquidity pool, helping to increase the value of your tokens and the pool&#8217;s size.</li></ul>



<p>Established liquidity pools can have up to $1 million invested in them, making them exceptionally reliable for inexperienced cryptocurrency traders. Smaller pools are more susceptible to market fluctuations, which might cause your coins&#8217; value to plummet. However, if you select the right pool, you may enjoy high-value stability while also earning transaction fees to supplement your initial investment.</p>



<h1>Does the crypto liquidity pool play a vital role in DeFi?</h1>



<p>Crypto liquidity pools are essential parts of the Decentralised Finance (DeFi) ecosystem, especially for Decentralised Exchanges (DEXs). Crypto liquidity pools allow users to pool their assets in a DEX&#8217;s smart contracts to offer asset liquidity for traders to swap currencies. As a result, liquidity pools provide much-needed liquidity, rapidity, and convenience to the DeFi ecosystem.</p>



<p>Crypto market liquidity was a barrier for Ethereum-based DEXs before the arrival of automated market makers (AMMs). At the time, DEXs were a new technology with a complex interface. The number of buyers and sellers was limited, making it challenging to locate enough individuals willing to trade daily. Without the need for third-party intermediaries, AMMs address the issue of low liquidity by building liquidity pools and rewarding liquidity providers to provide assets to these pools. The more convenient it is to trade on <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/can-decentralized-exchanges-dex-become-mainstream/" data-wpel-link="internal">Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)</a>, the more assets and liquidity a pool has.</p>



<h1>Advantages of crypto liquidity pools</h1>



<p>While participating in liquidity pools might be difficult for crypto newbies at first, the advantages of these new financial protocols indicate that liquidity pools are here to stay.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s have a look at the below advantages:</p>



<ul><li>Liquidity pools guarantee that DeFi protocols, notably decentralized exchanges, and lending platforms, have enough liquidity.</li><li>Many market makers do not have access to liquidity. Anyone can contribute to a pool&#8217;s liquidity.</li><li>Liquidity providers have access to several levels of income potential by deploying their liquidity provider tokens on multiple DeFi protocols.</li><li>By earning governance tokens and voting with them, liquidity providers can participate in the decision-making process of a protocol for which they offer liquidity.</li><li>Liquidity pools allow traders to transact without fear of losing their money.</li></ul>



<h1>Final words</h1>



<p>The expansion of crypto liquidity pools bodes well for the future of cryptocurrency and DeFi in general. Liquidity pools eliminate the need for crypto transactions to wait for matching orders. Simultaneously, the use of smart contracts in liquidity pools means that the finest liquidity pools may be programmed to meet specific criteria.</p>



<p>Liquidity pools can help open the crypto and DeFi space to additional consumers and resolve concerns about crypto market liquidity. In addition, liquidity pools can help new traders and liquidity providers overcome trust concerns in bitcoin trading.</p>

<p>The advancement of decentralized blockchain networks is essential for easy engagement and interoperability. Since the inception of Bitcoin in 2009, the number of blockchain networks has increased dramatically, with diverse designs and functionality.</p>



<p>As the blockchain community expands, restrictions in inter-network communication and data sharing have emerged, raising doubts about decentralization, as blockchain networks are meant to be governed by millions of participants rather than a centralized organization. In addition, because programs designed for one network only operate on that network, this has led to a lower adoption rate.</p>



<p>Various initiatives have been established to link networks, allowing for simple data flow and sharing between networks while also increasing adoption.</p>



<p>In this blog, we&#8217;ll look at what blockchain bridges are, how they function, the benefits and concerns associated with them, and the fundamental two types of bridges.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s get started.</p>



<h1>What are blockchain bridges (cross-chain bridges)?</h1>



<p>A blockchain bridge, also known as a <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/why-is-cross-chain-technology-crucial-in-blockchain-interoperability/" data-wpel-link="internal">cross-chain</a> bridge, is a technology that links two blockchains and enables users to transfer bitcoin from one to the other. In other words, if you have bitcoin and wish to spend it like Ethereum, you may do so via the bridge.</p>



<p>One of the most serious issues with blockchain was the inability to collaborate. While each blockchain is flexible and relatively efficient as a separate entity, it is constrained by the boundaries of its domain. This can frequently result in high transaction costs and latency.</p>



<p>With blockchain bridges, token transfers, smart contracts, data sharing, and other feedback and specifications between two distinct platforms are all possible.</p>



<p>These blockchains issue different currencies and follow other regulations; the bridge acts as a neutral zone, allowing users to transfer between them seamlessly. For most of us, having access to numerous blockchains over the same network dramatically improves our crypto experience.</p>



<p>Even though the two systems serve distinct goals, this idea is quite similar to Layer 2 solutions. Layer 2 is constructed on top of an existing blockchain; thus, while it improves speed, interoperability is still a problem. Cross-chain bridges are also separate entities that are not part of any blockchain.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s consider an example:</p>



<p>You&#8217;re from the United States and considering a vacation to Europe. You have dollars, but you need euros to make a purchase. You may swap your USD for euros for a small fee at a currency exchange.</p>



<p>But what if you want to perform a similar transaction with a different blockchain? This is where blockchain bridges come into play.</p>



<h1>Working of the blockchain bridges</h1>



<p>Let’s consider the following scenario with two blockchain networks: Chain A and Chain B.</p>



<p>The bridge can be constructed to lock the token on Chain A and create a new one on Chain B when moving tokens from Chain A to Chain B. The overall amount of circulating tokens remain unchanged in this situation, but it is split across the two chains. Chain A will still have fifteen tokens (with five tokens locked) after transferring five to Chain B, but Chain B would have five more.</p>



<p>The minted tokens&#8217; owner can redeem them at any moment by burning (or destroying) them on Chain B and unlocking (or releasing) them on Chain A. The value of each token remains consistent with the chain A market price since Chain A has always had a locked copy of it. This &#8220;lock-and-mint&#8221; and &#8220;burn-and-release&#8221; mechanism maintains the number and cost of tokens exchanged between the two chains.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s consider another practical example:</p>



<p>When you have bitcoin and wish to move part of it to Ethereum, the blockchain bridge will store it and convert it to ETH equivalents for you to utilize. There is no movement of any of the crypto involved. Instead, the amount of BTC you wish to send is locked in a smart contract, and you get an identical amount of ETH in exchange. When you wish to convert back to BTC, the ETH you had, or whatever remains of it, will be burnt, and an equivalent amount of BTC will be returned to your wallet.</p>



<h1>Advantages of the blockchain bridge</h1>



<p><strong>Cross-chain transactions</strong></p>



<p>Each blockchain is constructed in a secure ecosystem with its own set of regulations and consensus methods, resulting in individual blockchain restrictions. As a result, there is no straight connectivity between blockchains or token transactions. On the other side, Blockchain bridges allow coins and information to be transferred from one chain to another.</p>



<p><strong>Less network traffic</strong></p>



<p>Blockchain bridges assist in moving traffic from busy blockchains, such as the Ethereum ecosystem, to less congested blockchains, hence improving the Ethereum network&#8217;s scalability.</p>



<p><strong>Improved developer experience</strong></p>



<p>Slow transaction processing speeds and high gas prices have caused problems for developers building <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-dapps/" data-wpel-link="internal">DApps</a> on the Ethereum network, especially during moments of heavy traffic and congestion. On the other hand, Blockchain bridges allow identical tokens to be processed on other blockchains more quickly and at a cheaper cost. As a result, developers from various blockchains continue to collaborate on new user platforms.</p>



<p><strong>Restriction to monopolization</strong></p>



<p>Cross-chain technology also helps keep markets stable by decreasing monopolization by large corporations. The most popular cryptocurrencies, for example, are Bitcoin and Ethereum, which account for more than 70% of the global market share. As a result of this hegemony, there is limited opportunity in the market for new businesses to test their strategies and get a footing in the current market.</p>



<h1>Types of blockchain bridges (in a nutshell)</h1>



<p>Bridges come in various types of designs and intricacies. Generally, they are divided into two categories: trusted and trustless bridges.</p>



<div class="wp-block-columns">
<div class="wp-block-column" style="flex-basis:100%">
<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center"><strong>Trusted Bridges</strong></td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center"><strong>Trustless Bridges</strong></td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">For their functioning, trusted bridges rely on a central <br>organization or system.</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Smart contracts and algorithms are used to manage trustless bridges.</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">They have trust implications about the bridge&#8217;s security and the safekeeping of cash. The reputation of the bridge operator <br>is primarily relied upon by users.</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">They are trustless, which means that the bridge&#8217;s security is identical to that of the underlying blockchain.</td></tr><tr><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Users must relinquish control over their crypto assets.</td><td class="has-text-align-center" data-align="center">Trustless bridges allow users to keep control of their cash by using smart contracts.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
</div>
</div>



<h1>Risks involved in blockchain bridges</h1>



<p>Bridges are still in the planning stage. It&#8217;s possible that the best bridge design has yet to be identified. Any interaction with a bridge is fraught with danger:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-are-smart-contracts-and-why-you-need-to-know-about-them/" data-wpel-link="internal">Smart Contract</a> Risk — the possibility of a programming bug resulting in the loss of user funds.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Technology Risk — Software failure, buggy coding, human mistakes, spam, and malicious attacks are all potential sources of disruption for users.</li></ul>



<p>Furthermore, since trusted bridges include new trust assumptions, they introduce new risks, such as</p>



<ul><li>Censorship Risk — bridge operators might hypothetically prevent users from moving assets across the bridge.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Custodial Risk — bridge operators may conspire to take payments from their customers.</li></ul>



<h1>Final thoughts</h1>



<p>Decentralization was always a key feature of blockchain; therefore, it takes precedence over other operational enhancements like scalability.</p>



<p>Developers are naturally hesitant of significant changes, worried that they would depart from the decentralizing principles. However, they&#8217;ve evolved past that attitude, as seen by the blockchain bridges they&#8217;ve developed. We may be making progress toward a more innovative and mainstream crypto economy, but any progress is preferable to the status quo.</p>

<p>The fall of stablecoin TerraUSD and its sister coin Luna, whose values fell earlier in May, put the cryptocurrency industry into a tailspin.</p>



<p>Wild price volatility in cryptocurrencies is nothing new. However, because TerraUSD is a so-called stablecoin, investors were taken aback by the abrupt decline in its price.</p>



<h2>Taking a step back: What actually happened?</h2>



<p>The algorithmic <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/a-comprehensive-guide-to-stablecoins/" data-wpel-link="internal">stablecoin</a> UST, which is constructed on top of the Terra protocol and is a driving force behind its whole ecosystem, lost its peg on May 9th. It was already selling at roughly $0.30 a few days later, a shocking 70% below its planned value of $1.</p>



<p>Because of how the algorithm works, traders could redeem 1 UST (which was trading below $1) for $1 worth of LUNA. The goal of this design was to destroy the UST and limit its supply, hence surging its value. However, selling pressure was extreme, and UST never got close to its $1 target.</p>



<p>This enabled dealers to print LUNA in large quantities, resulting in a tremendous supply of over 6 trillion LUNA in a very few days. Such rapid supply growth in such a short period with no ability to accept it became unavoidable — LUNA&#8217;s price plummeted to $0.</p>



<p>In the event that will linger on in crypto history, the whole Terra ecosystem was swept out, and billions of dollars disappeared from the market in less than a week.</p>



<h2>Luna 2.0: Introduction to the revival plan</h2>



<p>Luna 2.0 will be the first token on the new Terra blockchain, and it will be used to save the Terra Luna ecosystem following the collapse of the stablecoin.</p>



<p>TerraForm Labs creator Do Kwon&#8217;s plan, dubbed the Luna rebirth, <a href="https://agora.terra.money/t/terra-ecosystem-revival-plan-2-passed-gov/18498" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">proposes</a> that a new chain replace the old Terra network. Luna 2.0 will also be replacing the current version of Luna. It will cut links with the UST stablecoin, which was the source of the crash in the first place.</p>



<p>Most dApps will migrate to the new chain in conjunction with the new chain.</p>



<p>Like the old Luna, the old chain will not just vanish; they will coexist. The previous chain will be called Terra Classic, while Luna Classic will see the present Luna remain.</p>



<p><strong>Here&#8217;s what you need to know</strong></p>



<ul><li>The original Blockchain will be known as Terra Classic, whereas Luna Classic will be the name of the Luna blockchain.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The original Luna logo will then be used to create a new blockchain.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Previous holders of Luna and UST will get tokens on this new Blockchain via an airdrop.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Investors who own more than 10,000 Luna tokens will receive just 30% of their tokens at first, with the remaining 70% distributed over two years to deter them from selling them all at once.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Those holding more than a million tokens will have to wait a year before receiving their tokens, which will then be subject to a four-year vesting period.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Huobi is one of the cryptocurrency exchanges that has already revealed plans to offer the new Luna coin.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Binance <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1529436477867835392/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">claimed</a> it is &#8220;working closely with the Terra team&#8221; to offer the &#8220;best possible service&#8221; to impacted Binance users.</li></ul>



<h2>Breakdown of the Revival plan</h2>



<p><strong>New Blockchain:</strong> The Terra Blockchain will be split into a new Blockchain but without the UST algorithmic Stablecoin UST mechanism&#8217;s unique layout.</p>



<p>Terra Classic (LUNC) will be the name of the old BlockchainBlockchain, whereas Terra will be the name of the new BlockchainBlockchain sans the UST structure (LUNA).</p>



<p><strong>Distribution Mechanism:</strong> The new token LUNA will be airdropped (i.e., offered for free) to all individuals that stake, i.e., seize or pledge their LUNA classic tokens, remaining USTs, and other Terra Classic ecosystem necessary tokens.</p>



<p><strong>Community-Based Crypto:</strong> Terra FormLab&#8217;s wallet address will be whitelisted for this specific LUNA airdrop, so only the Terra FormLab community will get it. Terra&#8217;s long-term ambition is to become a community-owned Blockchain.</p>



<p><strong>Token Reset:</strong> As part of the resurrection plan, the total number of new LUNA tokens in active circulation was set to 1 billion.</p>



<p><strong>New Inflation Rate:</strong> According to Do Kwon&#8217;s revival plan, present revenue sources will not be enough to meet security costs without boosting swap fees. As a result, he requested community members to incentivize network security in line with the native crypto token&#8217;s inflation, which should be set at 7% per year.</p>



<h2>Launch date of Luna 2.0</h2>



<p>After a successful vote, Luna 2.0 will go live on May 28th, the same day as the Terra chain&#8217;s genesis block.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://twitter.com/terra_money/status/1530047587709067264/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">tweet from Terra</a>, the Luna 2.0 launch will take place at approximately 6 a.m. UTC (2 a.m. ET, 11 p.m. PT).</p>



<p>Terra has pushed back the debut date by one day, which was initially scheduled for May 27th.</p>



<h2>Final thoughts</h2>



<p>While the LUNA revival plan appears to eliminate UST and transform the network into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), it remains to be seen if it will genuinely aid in the recovery of the Terra ecosystem as a whole.</p>



<p>However, the cryptocurrency industry was severely shocked by the loss of $60 billion following the catastrophic <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/luna-crashes-over-99-whats-happening-with-this-cryptocurrency/" data-wpel-link="internal">Luna crash</a>. Nonetheless, it appears that the rebirth of Luna has piqued the interest of investors.</p>



<p>Getting rid of the stablecoin that caused Luna&#8217;s fall in the first place may boost the new crypto&#8217;s chances of success. Still, investors should exercise caution while investing in crypto because anything can happen in this unpredictable market.</p>

<h2>What is Stop-Limit order?</h2>



<p>A stop-limit order is a form of limit order that allows traders to protect their profits as well as limit losses, reducing the risks associated with erratic market movements. To create a stop-limit order, you&#8217;ll need to first choose the stop price, limit price, and order volume.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Stop Price:</strong> The price at which your limit order will be triggered and entered into the order book.</li><li><strong>Limit Price: </strong>Your order will be placed in the order book at the limit price.</li></ul>



<p>When the market reaches or goes through the Stop Price, a Limit Order will be placed at the Limit Price.</p>



<p>How to place a Stop-Limit order?</p>



<ol><li>Click on the drop-down list in the Buy/Sell Form.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Q46FaEEv35tYBnveLML-mPF_-6oC0mNKBvcrU9ax0LfKMgT7pZi8csbHzzJOqD2d4ZRu5Gbg0yFYR3Fe-raG-c-UNkC3TmKiOdqlBuy-Z5LfoP_xobaPSYLINrQ8YT0Wc9yJSEa7DLT5gQH4Wg" alt="" /></figure></div>

<ol start="5"><li>Enter the amount of crypto you&#8217;re looking to buy. You can also use the % buttons to automatically fill the amount.</li></ol>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/djVwpIFa4WdYTadf2J_qQGAmqmEPu-9qs2pJvsR8aA-m8N-4T0dnmob9O879VZYAT-DlocsDgWcMbOeOxCYCSDOI3IbGlqgIOgRaGcKfBFjNkNhctPMzx_SFQiEr3Ju_ELsWJgm4UrulXVDZxg" alt="" /></figure></div>



<ol start="6"><li>Click on the Buy button.</li></ol>



<h4><strong>Please note:&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<ul><li>The Stop Price and Limit Price can be the same. However, we recommend the following:<ul><li><strong>For Sell Orders:</strong> Set the Stop Price higher than the Limit Price. This will increase the likelihood of your Sell Limit Order being executed. In case the liquidity in the Order Book is low or the market goes through too fast.</li><li><strong>For Buy Orders: </strong>Set the Stop Price lower than the Limit Price. This will increase the likelihood of your Buy Limit Order being executed. In case the liquidity in the Order Book is low or the market goes through too fast.</li></ul></li><li>Triggering the Stop Price and placing the Limit Order does not guarantee that your order will be fully filled or executed. Sometimes, the liquidity may be low at your Limit Price or the market may go through your limit price too fast. In these cases, your Limit Order will remain fully or partially open in the Order Book.</li><li>Sometimes, while the Stop Price may be triggered, the market may not reach your Limit Price. In this case, too, your Limit Order will remain fully or partially open in the Order Book.<ul><li><strong>Example (Buy): </strong>Let’s say you want to buy LTC when the market price reaches $50, but don’t want to buy above $52. Set a Stop Limit order with a Stop Price of $50 and a Limit Price of $52. When the market reaches $50, your Buy Limit Order for $52 will be automatically placed in the Order Book and matched to the best available sell orders up to $52.</li><li><strong>Example (Sell): </strong>Let’s say you want to sell LTC when the market price reaches $70, and sell everything within $65. Set a Stop Limit order with a Stop Price of $70 and a Limit Price of $65. When the market reaches $70, your Sell Limit Order for $65 will be automatically placed in the Order Book and matched to the best available Buy orders up to $65.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>Happy Trading!!</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies, like foreign exchange markets where currencies are constantly exchanged, require their marketplaces for users to purchase, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. However, since decentralization is such an essential feature of bitcoin trading, there was a demand for decentralized exchanges (DEX) &#8211; trading without the cost or manipulation of a third party, for exchanges without a centralized point of authority.</p>



<p>DEX allows for peer-to-peer transactions without the use of intermediaries and a plethora of additional advantages. As a result, everyone interested in the crypto world will undoubtedly be curious about the fundamentals of DEX, or decentralized exchange, and its capabilities.</p>



<p>This blog attempts to serve as a detailed overview of DEXs, the key differences between DEX &amp; CEX, how they work, and how users can interact with them. In addition, you can also find an overview of the advantages and disadvantages associated with DEXs and their evolution.</p>



<h2>Decentralized Exchange (DEX): Definition</h2>



<p>One of the essential components of the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-defi/" data-wpel-link="internal">decentralized finance</a> (DeFi) ecosystem is decentralized exchanges. A decentralized exchange (DEX) is a platform that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with one another without the use of a middleman.</p>



<p>Decentralized Exchanges are essentially a platform for investors to anonymously and securely purchase, sell, and exchange their crypto assets. To avoid cryptocurrency arbitrage, they employ Automated Market Maker methods to adjust the price of each coin.</p>



<p>Before we go any further, it&#8217;s crucial to understand the distinction between a decentralized exchange (DEX) and a centralized exchange (CEX). So let&#8217;s have a look at them!</p>



<h2>Key differences between DEX and CEX</h2>



<ul><li>DEXes are non-custodial (you have custody of your crypto at all times), whereas CEXs are custodial (they keep control of any funds you deposit on their platforms).</li></ul>



<ul><li>DEXes are particularly well-suited to long-tail asset trading, which involves trading many small, low-volume cryptocurrencies because of their open and permissionless nature. CEXs are mainly ideal for short-tail asset trading, i.e., facilitating large volumes around the top cryptocurrencies, due to regulatory concerns.</li></ul>



<ul><li>On the other hand, regulatory requirements allow CEXs to provide direct business-to-consumer safeguards such as deposit insurance, customer service guarantees, and more. DEXes aren&#8217;t businesses; thus, they don&#8217;t come with any of these standard safeguards.</li></ul>



<h2>How does Decentralized Exchange work?</h2>



<p>A decentralized exchange facilitates trade between individuals by using smart contracts (automatically executed protocols), but it does not assume ownership of their currency.</p>



<p>DEXs use one of three methods to deal with this: an on-chain order book, an off-chain order book, or an automated market maker.</p>



<p><strong>On-chain order book</strong></p>



<p>Every transaction in an on-chain order book is recorded on a blockchain. This includes the transaction itself and the request to purchase or cancel an item. Although it is the pinnacle of decentralization, the requirement to place everything on a blockchain can make it more expensive and time-consuming.</p>



<p><strong>Off-chain order book</strong></p>



<p>All of this happens off-chain through off-chain order books, with just the final transaction being resolved on the blockchain. This solution can run into some security difficulties of centralized exchanges because orders aren&#8217;t stored on-chain, but it isn&#8217;t as sluggish or expensive as on-chain order books.</p>



<p><strong>Automated Market Makers (AMM)</strong></p>



<p>Automated Market Makers (AMM) do not use order books. If you have <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/a-short-guide-to-chainlink/" data-wpel-link="internal">Chainlink</a> tokens and wish to acquire Compound, you&#8217;ll need to find someone who has Compound and is prepared to trade at an agreed-upon price via order books.</p>



<p>AMMs eliminate counterparties and replace them with algorithms that determine the price, allowing you to trade Chainlink for Compound independent of who is on the other end of the exchange. They usually do this by using &#8220;liquidity pools,&#8221; which effectively pay users to hold some of their money in a smart contract that can later be used for trading. As a result, individual users play a crucial role in enabling exchanges.</p>



<h2>User interaction with DEX</h2>



<p>Unlike centralized exchanges, there are no accounts, Know Your Customer checks, or particular restrictions governing who may use a DEX. They are trustless and permissionless, allowing them to be used by anybody with a bitcoin wallet and funds.</p>



<p>As a result, users cannot keep any cryptocurrency on a decentralized exchange; instead, they must connect via various cold or hot wallets, such as MetaMask, a non-custodial browser wallet. Once a wallet is linked, the user may trade any cryptocurrency kept on the wallet anonymously or access dApps and associated protocols within the Decentralised Exchange, thereby turning it into a DeFi (Decentralized Finance) gateway.</p>



<h2>Advantages of DEX</h2>



<p>In recent years, decentralized crypto exchanges have emerged as one of the most promising channels for crypto trading. The following are some advantages that are seen in practically every inclusion on a decentralized exchange list:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Token&#8217;s availability</strong></li></ul>



<p>Decentralized exchanges make tokens more accessible, especially those created on the blockchain on which they were created. As a result, new projects would publish their coins on the exchanges before listing them on centralized exchanges.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Anonymity</strong></li></ul>



<p>The second significant benefit of decentralized exchanges is that users may remain anonymous. With decentralized crypto exchanges, users are not required to undergo standard identification procedures such as Know Your Customer or KYC processes.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Reduced counterparty risk</strong></li></ul>



<p>When one of either party fails to keep their end of the bargain during a transaction, it is known as counterparty risk. The basic definition of a decentralized exchange (DEX) demonstrates how smart contracts help DEXs enable transactions. As a result, you won&#8217;t have to rely on an intermediary for transactions, and you&#8217;ll be free of counterparty risk.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Enhanced security</strong></li></ul>



<p>A decentralized exchange (DEX) is distinguished by the fact that it does not control its customers&#8217; cash. On the other hand, traders retain custody of their funds and have complete control over how they engage with the DEX.</p>



<h2>Disadvantages of DEX</h2>



<p>Apart from the specific advantages of decentralized exchanges, it&#8217;s also critical to recognize the hazards that come with them.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Specific knowledge requirement</strong></li></ul>



<p>Users should be familiar with security principles to protect their cash in a DEX crypto exchange. Furthermore, you must possess technical understanding in the choosing of wallets as well as the funding of the wallet with appropriate tokens.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Unverified token listings</strong></li></ul>



<p>Any individual can issue a new token on a decentralized crypto market with the goal of increasing liquidity. For investors, however, this might lead to rug pull frauds. As a result, investors may buy tokens with the expectation of receiving another token. As a result, traders must conduct due research before investing in tokens.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Risks of smart contract</strong></li></ul>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-are-smart-contracts-and-why-you-need-to-know-about-them/" data-wpel-link="internal">Smart contract</a> risks are the ultimate addition to the hazards connected with a DEX exchange. Exploitable defects in smart contracts might elude thorough audits and code inspections, resulting in more damage.</p>



<h2>Final words: Evolution of DEX</h2>



<p>The first decentralized exchange was launched in 2014, and its popularity has grown in tandem with the rise of DeFi. In addition, DEXs have progressed past their traditional order book hurdles thanks to the Automated Market Maker technology capabilities. On the other hand, decentralized crypto exchanges have proven to be crucial venues for users to borrow cash to leverage their holdings or provide liquidity to gain trading fees.</p>



<p>By placing their crypto assets in liquidity pools, DEXs have also enabled users to generate passive income on their crypto holdings. The usage of smart contracts in DEXs, on the other hand, continues to bring concerns.</p>



<p>More use cases may be generated in the future because these platforms are based on self-executing smart contracts. Flash loans, which are loans acquired and repaid in a single transaction, are an example of how decentralized finance innovation may enable the creation of previously unimaginable goods and services.</p>



<p>Decentralized Exchanges have the potential to become popular based on all of these facts. So how do you feel about this?</p>

<p>As a leader in the play-to-earn (P2E) sector, Axie Infinity has demonstrated to the world the potential of blockchain gaming. NFT games based on the Axie-textbook model quickly appeared after Axie&#8217;s rise to stardom, many of which put their own spin on the concept. As a result, a diverse selection of new games has been created that appeal to a wide range of players.</p>



<p>In this article, I will discuss some existing and upcoming games that have sparked the interest of the community.</p>



<h2>1. <strong>StepN</strong></h2>



<p>STEPN is the first fitness game in which players may earn money just by moving around rather than by playing or winning. All STEPN sneakers, whether purchased from Magic Eden or the in-game STEPN shop, may be used to enter the game. The sneakers come in many various sorts and qualities, and players will have to make strategic judgments in choosing a pair that optimizes their profits. In general, the more the characteristics and rarities, the better the sneakers.</p>



<p>With just 100 minutes of continuous gameplay, each user will have a maximum of 100 pairs of shoes and a restricted amount of revenue-generating gameplay (also known as &#8220;workout minutes&#8221;). On average, having three pairs of shoes (not improved) will provide a profit of ~17, counting daily maintenance costs. At current pricing, it comes to ~$55 per day! Not bad for just 45 minutes of activity, especially for the fitness freaks out there.</p>



<h2><strong>2. Crabada</strong></h2>



<p>Playing games, especially one with as high stakes as the present version of Axie Infinity, where you must win to earn, may be stressful. Not to consider the time spent watching the battles when you actively control your Axies. For those of you who are thinking, &#8220;that&#8217;s a lot of work,&#8221; we may have the solution for you.</p>



<p>Crabada is Avalanche&#8217;s most popular play-and-earn game. Players require at least 3 crabs to go on mining excursions, which take roughly 4 hours to accomplish if unbothered by looters. The player gains 3.75 CRA and 303.75 TUS for successfully mining without being robbed by an opponent team. So what makes Crabada unique? Right now, it simply sounds like Axie Infinity 2.0.</p>



<p>What distinguishes Crabada is that it is an idle game. What this implies is that the act of plundering and mining for instance are hands-free &#8211; you won&#8217;t need to be present to make every move for your crabs, they may run the show themselves. In addition, players and CRA hodlers may use the site to stake their CRA and earn rewards.</p>



<p>If that&#8217;s not enough to get you started, consider that the top 11 earners on Crabada combined made more than $5 million previously. However, the problem is that crabs now cost at least $1,300, which means gamers would need to shell out $3,900 to get started. Crabada has historically been a highly successful &#8220;game,&#8221; but its hefty entry cost makes participation difficult for the average gamer.</p>



<h2><strong>3. Ember Sword</strong></h2>



<p>Ember Sword is a forthcoming free-to-play MMORPG set in the eponymous digital world, which features four nations, namely Solarwood, Duskeron, Edison, and Sevrend. The gameplay is reminiscent of Runescape, a 90s internet phenomenon. Players will be able to move freely across the world to hunt and kill monsters, bosses, and competing players to level up. It is possible for players who prefer to work as master craftsmen or merchants to scout the globe in quest of unique, tradable NFT objects that can be made from common and uncommon materials.</p>



<p>The game contains an ERC-20 token called Ember, which can be used to buy land, collectibles, subscription plans, and more. Ember Sword does not contain any pay-to-win aspects, and any purchases made will not provide its owners an unfair edge.</p>



<p>What makes Ember Sword distinctive is also its approach towards world-building. It&#8217;s important to note that Ember Sword&#8217;s land (which is an NFT) is collectively owned by its players, as opposed to other massively multiplayer online role-playing games such as MapleStory, Runescape, Ragnarok, and more. Pre-alpha testing for Ember Sword will begin in 2022, when it will be made available to the public.</p>



<h2><strong>4. Illuvium</strong></h2>



<p>Illuvium is one of the most eagerly awaited P2E games for 2022. It is hailed as the first AAA blockchain-based game to hit the cryptoverse. The game sends the player on an expedition within a magical open-world, where they must explore and catch roaming animals of the planet called Illuvials. Illuvials and other in-game items are held on-chain as NFTs in the player&#8217;s wallet and therefore may be sold for profit or exchanged freely. Illuvium also features an auto-battler system comparable to the ones in DOTA Auto Chess and Teamfight Tactics. Illuvium can be compared to Pokemon, except instead of the classic turn-based combat system, it uses a 3D auto-fight in an enclosed Arena.</p>



<p>Also, much like Pokemon, Illuvials may come in many various classes and affinities, each with its own weaknesses and strengths that players can maneuver around in the Arena. In addition to the core game, there is also Illuvium:Zero, a construction game that adds a land component to Illuvium, enabling players to cultivate resources on their land to develop their own industrial complex.</p>



<h2><strong>5. Aurory</strong></h2>



<p>This is the narrative of two universes. Both Antik and Tokane are other realities uncovered by the elusive Satoshi Nakamoto, one of the world&#8217;s most famous cryptographic sleuths. And, in case you&#8217;re unfamiliar with the name, the hero of this amazing narrative is named Sam (check the ecosystem to see why).</p>



<p>It&#8217;s interesting how the narrative of Aurory shows the contradiction between centralization and decentralization, one that the cryptoverse can connect to and unite around. Slap on aspects of Pokemon and Studio Ghibli influenced aesthetics and you have one amazing bundle.</p>



<p>Aurory&#8217;s main gameplay is similar to that of traditional Pokemon games, in that it takes place in a large, open environment where players capture and use Nefties, creatures they find, in turn-based combat. One major distinction is that Aurory is a play-to-earn game whereas Nefty is a tradable or sellable NFT. Players can get involved in both PVE and PVP combat to win prizes.</p>



<p>Aurory appears to be a stunning game with Ghibli-style calm, based on gameplay footage shown in trailers. Aurory may be the perfect entry point into the world of blockchain Tokane for Pokemon players interested in a play-to-earn counterpart.</p>



<h2><strong>6. Pegaxy</strong></h2>



<p>Have you ever dreamed of owning a renowned horse like Seabiscuit or maybe the legendary Pegasus? Now is your chance. Pegaxy could be the thing for you &#8211; without any of the normal bother associated with horse raising. For as much as 200 USDT, you can get your hands on a magnificent winged horse named Pega, which you may use to compete in races to contend for the top 3 slots. Pegas exist in numerous sizes, forms, and stats, but the basic rule of thumb is greater stats = better.</p>



<p>Pegaxy also has an unique trustless leasing mechanism in place to support the scholar-owner transactional connection. In the game, players can breed, rent, sell and of course, race their Pegas. Each race will take on average 2 minutes to finish, with the top 3 victors collecting VIS rewards. What counts in a race is how well your Pega lines up to the Track. For instance, a Pega with high Fire attributes will be more likely to do well on a Fire track. With further updates planned, I expect the game&#8217;s player population to continue to increase in the coming months and years as well.</p>



<h2><strong>7. Genopets</strong></h2>



<p>The move-to-earn strategy is back. Just like STEPN, you move, you earn. But what Genopets is doing distinctively is that it provides a Pokemon-esque gamified advancement mechanism. A more powerful Genopet NFT may be created using the in-game prizes that you acquire by moving about the game world and interacting with other Genopets.</p>



<p>The Genopets website also stresses the need of working out your &#8220;mind and spirit&#8221; in addition to your muscles. In the demo, for example, hatching a Genopet takes channeling your &#8220;cognitive exertion,&#8221; and the emerging Genopet is one that best compliments your spiritual being. Crystal mints, the ingredients required to build Genopet Habitats (i.e., lands), can only be obtained through a series of cipher riddles, which users must solve in order to access them.</p>



<p>In terms of fundamental gameplay, Genopets and STEPN appear to be almost identical, with the exception of a few design differences that may appeal to various segments of the fitness community. However, who says you can&#8217;t run both in the background throughout your workout?</p>



<h2><strong>8. Thetan Arena</strong></h2>



<p>Like other MOBA games, Thetan Arena provides players with a wide range of heroes to choose from, including anything from assassins to tank commanders to sharpshooters. Beginners will be given a free marksman hero named Raidon. This hero will help you gain experience and unlock new goodies. These benefits may either be cashed out or reinvested into paid heroes or loot boxes to improve your earning potential.</p>



<p>Like its mobile non-play-to-earn equivalent, Brawl Stars, Thetan Arena likewise offers several game modes, with each mode having unique victory conditions that demand for different strategies. MOBA is an established and tested formula that has a big following of (often vociferous) supporters. If you appreciate a fast-paced, action-packed, skills-based challenge contrasted to the traditional, more peaceful play-to-earn games, certainly give Thetan Arena a try.</p>



<h2><strong>9. DeFi Kingdoms</strong></h2>



<p>Defi Kingdoms may be seen as a DeFi protocol environment wrapped in the guise of a 16-bit adventure game, which is a little tongue in cheek. As with previous Defi protocols, the cost to start is simply the amount you are prepared to commit, and so can vary dramatically from individual to individual.</p>



<p>However, the real fun comes once you secure a Hero from Agent Selina (i.e., secondary marketplace for Hero NFTs). These are characters that may work in several professions (i.e., miner, gardener, forager) for rewards, go on Adventure and Profession missions, and ultimately combat each other or other opponents in future versions. For instance, mining will give your Hero Mining profession experience points, which should boost your wealth as well as your stamina. Several more NPCs can be encountered in-game, like Vendor Zaya (NFT item shop), Banker Ian (JEWEL staking), Druid Lisa (Hero minting), and many more thereafter.</p>



<p>Defi Kingdoms is a good place to start if you&#8217;ve never used any DeFi protocols before, owing to the steep learning curve. Even for the DeFi professionals, DeFi Kingdoms is a lovely game that provides unique gamification of what is normally a drab, mercenarial affair.</p>



<h2><strong>10. Bomb Crypto</strong></h2>



<p>The source of inspiration for this game is obvious. In Bomb Crypto, players construct and control a squad of Bomber Heroes. Like traditional Bomberman, these heroes may be deployed in a confined arena where they will start arbitrarily planting bombs to mine for BCOIN. The abilities of heroes (strength, speed, endurance, bomb quantity, bomb range) impact their efficiency in unearthing treasures. For instance, a higher speed indicates that the hero will be able to sprint about in the arena faster. The basic rule of thumb is the rarer the hero, the greater the numbers.</p>



<p>Running around across the arena depletes your hero&#8217;s stamina, and once it hits zero, you must rest your hero to replenish it &#8211; a process that may be accelerated by building a house for your heroes to rest in.</p>



<p>Bomb Crypto swiftly garnered popularity for its simplicity, inexpensive cost-of-entry, and not to mention the 90s nostalgia with its Bomberman-inspired aesthetic.</p>



<h2><strong>Closing thoughts</strong></h2>



<p>Axie Infinity&#8217;s monopoly over play-to-earn is gone. Crypto games are now diverse and imaginative, with AAA titles like Illuvium and Aurory in development. In 2022, there will be far too many games to cover in one article. Whether you&#8217;re a crypto veteran or not, these are games you should keep an eye out for!</p>

<p>WazirX P2P (peer to peer) helps investors convert their Fiat to Crypto (and vice versa) instantly. This is&nbsp;absolutely free and is available 24×7 while being safe and legal!! To know how to use WazirX P2P, read our blog <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-to-use-wazirx-p2p-questions-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">here</a>.</p>



<p>Here are the questions that our users frequently ask. I am sure that if you have any doubts, this post will clear it all.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Question 1: Why does WazirX P2P only have USDT?</strong></p>



<p>USDT is a stable coin. To keep transactions simple and ensure very high liquidity, USDT alone is supported.</p>



<p><strong>Question 2: Who can use WazirX P2P?</strong></p>



<p>Users with Indian KYC can use the P2P feature on WazirX.</p>



<p><strong>Question 3: I am unable to see the seller&#8217;s bank details and the trade is automatically getting canceled in 10 minutes. What to do?</strong></p>



<p>Here, you need to select a payment option first. Then, click on the &#8220;Yes, I will pay&#8221; option after your trade is matched. Only after you click on &#8220;Yes, I will pay&#8221; the seller&#8217;s bank details will be visible to you. Based on these details you can proceed with payment.</p>



<p><strong>Question 4: I am unable to transfer the funds to the seller&#8217;s bank account as the details are incorrect/getting failed/banking issue/network problem.</strong></p>



<p>You will have to reach out to our support team via chat to cancel the order and waive the penalty. The support team will ask you to share screenshots/proofs to validate the genuine failure. Alternatively, once the trade is automatically canceled (after the time has lapsed) you will receive a penalty email. You can reply to this email with appropriate proof. If convinced, our team will reverse the penalty.</p>



<p><strong>Question 5: What to do if you make the payment but forget to click on ‘I have Paid’?</strong></p>



<p>You will have 10 minutes to click on the ‘Raise Dispute’ option. Once you raise a dispute, you will immediately get an email from our dispute team requesting payment proof. Then, within the next 15 minutes, please reach out to our support team via chat, following the instructions mentioned in the email. The dispute team will then review your payment proof along with other details and make a final decision on your dispute. The decision of the dispute team is final and binding and cannot be reversed.</p>



<p>Please Note: We have a multi-check fool-proof process that ensures complete accuracy when reviewing a dispute.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Question 6: How does the recovery (of funds) work if a transaction fails on WazirX P2P – when the buyer cancels the trade instead of confirming the trade?</strong></p>



<p>When the Buyer makes the payment and then cancels the transaction, we share the buyer’s payment details with the seller and ask them to make the payment back to the buyer. To ensure that the buyer gets their funds back, we lock the seller’s funds and/or account and send an email with all the information along with the payment proof. We send a total of 3 reminders to the Seller once every 24 hours. After the 3rd and final reminder, we proceed with funds recovery, which takes up to 13 business days (However, this only works when the funds are available).</p>



<p><strong>Question 7: Even after making payment, my trade is moved to dispute; what to do?</strong></p>



<p>Your trade could be moved to dispute for multiple reasons. In this case, you can reach out to our support team on chat with the payment proof. Be assured that your funds will be safe.</p>



<p><strong>Question 8: I am a seller/buyer, and I don&#8217;t want to be auto-matched with unknown buyers/sellers. What to do?</strong></p>



<p>If you would like to trade your crypto with someone, in particular, you can add their XID at the first step itself. XID works like a username! With this, the Buyer/Seller will be of your choice, and you won’t get matched with anyone else during that particular transaction.</p>



<p><strong>Question 9: Is there a daily limit on the number/value of P2P transactions I can do in a day?</strong></p>



<p>No! You can do any number of P2P transactions in a day on WazirX. However, your bank might have certain limits to which you will have to adhere to.</p>



<p><strong>Question 10: I am a buyer. After making the payment, my transaction is stuck at ‘Processing’. What should I do? I don’t know if the funds have been deducted or not.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>In cases when you have made the payment but the payment status shows ‘Processing’, you can click on &#8216;Yes, I have paid’ on WazirX and attach the proof of payment (processing) and wait for the seller to confirm the receipt of payment. If the seller receives the payment, the transaction will be processed. In case the payment is canceled, you can reach out to our support team via chat, and we will cancel the order for you and will also reverse the penalty as this was a genuine error.</p>



<p>To get a better overview, check this video on P2P by WazirX.</p>

</div></figure>



<p><strong>Question 11: What are the safety measures taken by WazirX?</strong></p>



<p>We understand that trusting unknown peers is difficult. To ensure that your funds are safe, WazirX has an escrow system to secure the entire transaction so that neither party can cheat the other. If you’re a seller – WazirX will not release your USDT to the buyer until you confirm the receipt of payment, and if you’re a buyer – WazirX will hold the seller’s USDT while you make a payment to the seller. We also verify the KYC details of every user before allowing them to trade on WazirX. A record of each and every transaction that occurs on our exchange is maintained.</p>



<p><strong>Question 12: The USDT received is lesser than the order placed. Why is this so?</strong></p>



<p>When an order is successfully processed, you will receive the assured USDT automatically into your account. Deductions, if any, could be penalties or outstanding trading fees. You can check the ledger in the Trading report to know more about these deductions.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Points to remember</h2>



<p>To ensure that your transactions are not canceled or rejected, please do keep these points in mind:</p>



<ul><li>As a buyer:<ul><li>Make sure to pay the matched seller only. Do not make payments to any other seller once your trade is matched.</li><li>Do not round off the amount to be paid. This means that if you have to pay 1198.20, please pay the exact figure that is 1198.20 (and not 1199 or 1200).</li><li>You should make payments only from your own account and not from any other (ex: family/friends) accounts, as this will be considered invalid. Once the payment is stuck in this case, the recovery will be as a 3rd party payment and not as a P2P one. Moreover, if the payment is made from a 3rd party account, the trade will always be settled in favor of the seller. Making 3rd party payments is not allowed on WazirX P2P and can result in your account getting flagged on the platform.</li><li>Once you have made the payment, ensure you confirm the same on the app. Here, while uploading the payment proof, make sure that the UTR (Unique Transaction Reference) number is visible.</li><li>Ensure to read the instructions on the screen correctly. For example, in the case of ‘Partial Order Matching’, make sure that specified amounts alone are paid to the right party.</li><li>In cases when your P2P payment has failed, we suggest you should not try to pay again immediately. Instead, you can contact our support team with the screenshot showing the failure of payment. Our team will help you cancel the trade and will also reverse the penalty as this was a genuine error. Once this is canceled, you can place a fresh order.</li></ul></li><li>As a seller:<ul><li>When payment is received, confirmation of receipt of payment is mandatory. In case this is not done, the dispute resolution team will take appropriate action.&nbsp;</li><li>If you have received payment from a third party (anyone other than the buyer), do not confirm the trade and reach out to us via chat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>The wait times are as follows:<ul><li>Once the trade is matched, as a buyer, you have 10 minutes to confirm if you would like to proceed with the transaction and pay for it.&nbsp;</li><li>To complete the payment and confirm the same, you (buyer) get 60 minutes.</li><li>The seller has to confirm the receipt of payment within 2 hours of the actual receipt. If he/she fails to do so, the transaction will automatically be shifted for dispute resolution.</li><li>Dispute resolution can be expected within 24-48 hours in most cases. However, if any case is stuck due to specific banking reasons, the resolution can take up to 3-5 banking days.</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>You can reach out to our support teams once this time period has lapsed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>The associated penalties are:<ul><li>If you have confirmed to make the payment but failed to do so and also have not canceled the transaction, you will be liable to pay a penalty of 10 USDT or 1.2% of transaction value, whichever is higher.</li><li>If you did not make the payment and still confirmed that you have done so, you will have to pay a penalty of 20 USDT or 2.4% of the transaction value, whichever is higher.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul>



<p>In genuine circumstances, the penalty can be reversed. Our support team will be the deciding authority here.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>When you raise support tickets or reach out to us via chat, please try to elaborate on your concern in detail. Providing appropriate screenshots will be beneficial for a speedy resolution.</li></ul>



<p>We hope these answers and pointers will help you in your P2P journey. In case you have any more questions, please feel free to add them in the comments below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Happy trading!</p>

<p>Traditional Financial (TradFi) services are reacting more than ever to their customers&#8217; needs and demands, acknowledging that the growing adoption of crypto assets as an investment class, the simplification of digital currencies, and the complex and challenging landscape in which they function, both operationally and regulatory, make their ability to adapt and innovate critical to their survival.</p>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-problems-can-defi-solve/" data-wpel-link="internal">Decentralized Finance</a> (DeFi) is a new technology that has the potential to transform various industries, including the finance industry. The industries can greatly benefit from combining both services.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s take the example of the banking sector. Banks increasingly recognize this industry as a key disruptor in their operating environment and as an opportunity. Most big banks now have departments and teams dedicated to bitcoin and digital asset strategy and development. The DeFi community should concentrate on finding methods to collaborate to integrate and educate.</p>



<h2>Key differences between DeFi and TradFi</h2>



<ul><li>The public and unchangeable blockchain serve as a decentralized trust source in DeFi. In the TradFi arena, legislative authorities and regulators, on the other hand, provide public governance, providing central points of control that might limit market access and raise the danger of manipulation.</li></ul>



<ul><li>DeFi is by definition more open and transparent than traditional financial systems, lowering barriers to entry and potentially increasing trust between users and lenders. This guarantees that financial services are accessible to everyone, including small businesses and households with inadequate or non-existent credit records.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The TradFi system&#8217;s highly regulated structure can make it difficult for innovators to participate fully. More precisely, before becoming a part of traditional finance systems, innovators and exchanges must secure required permits and accreditation from authorities, making it challenging to develop or produce solutions that benefit clients.</li></ul>



<p>As can be seen, these distinctions show why DeFi benefits unbanked companies so much while also revealing how the technology might boost innovation in the traditional financial field.</p>



<p>These disparities, of course, pose a concern, especially when considering the lack of regulatory safeguards and how they might affect both lenders and borrowers.</p>



<h2>Is DeFi considered better than TradFi?</h2>



<p>One of the main reasons for the belief that DeFi would supplant traditional finance is because blockchain cryptography makes safe transactions more accessible, quicker, and more efficient. Overall, society will benefit from an upgraded and well-designed financial system. DeFi, for example, removes fees charged by banks and other financial organizations just for accessing their services. This enables individuals to have actual ownership of their money in a straightforward and permissionless manner. So, if you wanted to send money to a cousin in another country, it would be a simple and quick process. As a result, Traditional Finance stands in sharp contrast.</p>



<p>As a result, it&#8217;s evident that Crypto is paving the way for a more efficient financial system and a decentralized future. As a result, the global central banking system is under attack because nothing will ever be able to stop growth if a system develops exponentially. Money, according to someone, is only a means to riches, not wealth itself. As a result, it will be obsolete once something more efficient replaces it. For example, much like Google replaced Yahoo, Crypto will eventually replace money in our current society.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the Crypto metaverse will continue to grow and has already begun to shake traditional financial structures. DeFi is quickly establishing itself as a transparent and permissionless technology. In 2022, the value of assets in DeFi is predicted to increase rapidly.</p>



<h2>Final thoughts: What the future beholds?</h2>



<p>Lastly, history shows that a revolution consuming an existing ecosystem, such as Traditional Finance (TradFi), is exceptionally rare. Given that digital photography has nearly wiped out film stocks and corporations like Kodak, it&#8217;s possible, but it&#8217;s improbable.</p>



<p>TradFi and DeFi are almost certainly going to combine. TradFi offers trust, size, and regulatory approval, whereas DeFi brings innovation.</p>



<p>People feel that DeFi will see a lot more attention over time and that this is only the beginning. Others claim that when &#8220;TradFi gets on<a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/blockchain-explained/" data-wpel-link="internal"> blockchain</a>,&#8221; &#8220;true magic applications&#8221; will emerge.</p>



<p>Today&#8217;s sci-fi meets tomorrow&#8217;s reality as TradFi meets DeFi.</p>

<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/trending-cryptocurrencies-to-invest-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">Cryptocurrency investment</a> has become a rage, especially among the millennials and Gen Z today. The pandemic outbreak pushed the momentum, and crypto adoption grew across sectors and verticals, individuals and institutions. </p>



<p>Though crypto markets continue to witness periods of volatility, they are no longer considered the wild west of investment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2022, the buzz around the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/best-metaverse-coins-to-invest-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">metaverse</a> and <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/web-3-0-cryptos-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">web 3.0</a>, the growing hype around Defi and dApps, and the blockchain gaming arena have brought further traction in the crypto markets and driven masses into considering crypto assets as a part of their portfolio.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/cheap-and-potential-cryptocurrencies-invest-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">thousands of cryptocurrencies</a> on the global cryptocurrency scene and more such projects arriving each day, the question persists &#8211; which is the best cryptocurrency to buy in May 2022?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Don’t worry. We have got you all covered. </p>



<p><strong>Read on to find the six best cryptocurrencies to buy in May 2022:</strong></p>



<p><em>(Market Cap and prices as of 16th May 2022)</em></p>



<h2>1. Bitcoin (BTC)</h2>



<p><em>Market Cap: $578Bn</em></p>



<p><em>Price: $30.343.46&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Introduced in 2009, <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/BTC-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Bitcoin</a> is the first of its kind and the most well-known form of crypto-currency. It is a peer-to-peer decentralized payment network. Bitcoin acts as a medium of exchange and a store of value.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After hitting an all-time high of approximately $69,000 in November 2021, Bitcoin stabilized for some time around $40,000 before it slumped to a major low this month (in May 2022). However, it still remains twice as valuable as it was a few years ago. Even with the recent decline in prices, experts predict a “pretty sustainable” rise, with some experts going as far as declaring <a href="https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-price-predictions/" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">a $100,000 threshold in near sight</a>. </p>



<p>Given its stature as the largest cryptocurrency and the number of institutions and corporations interested in it, <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-to-buy-bitcoin-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a> continues to remain the top crypto to buy in May 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>2. Ethereum (ETH)</h2>



<p><em>Market Cap : $250Bn</em></p>



<p><em>Price: $2073.70</em></p>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/ETH-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Ethereum</a> hosts the most popular altcoin ETH and is a blockchain-based software network with a wide variety of applications. Developers and platforms from the music, gaming, entertainment, and DeFi industry use the network to develop and host their applications.&nbsp;Use cases such as <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/best-nft-marketplace-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFTs</a>, Defi, DAOs, and other smart-contract-based utilities make ETH one of the most popular cryptos to buy in May.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Due to its popularity, Ethereum’s prices have skyrocketed over the past two years. An <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-to-buy-ethereum-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum</a> upgrade is awaited in late 2022, which will supposedly reduce its high fees and carbon footprint. A price prediction by <a href="https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/ethereum-price-predictions/#:~:text=The%20crypto%20news%20outlet%20Coinpedia,to%20rise%20from%20sentiment%20alone." data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg analyst </a><a href="https://twitter.com/mikemcglone11?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Mike McGlone</a><a href="https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/ethereum-price-predictions/#:~:text=The%20crypto%20news%20outlet%20Coinpedia,to%20rise%20from%20sentiment%20alone." data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer"> stated that Ether could end the year between $4000-$4500</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>3. Solana (SOL)</h2>



<p><em>Market Cap: $18Bn</em></p>



<p><em>Price : $55.27&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>An open-source project created in 2017, <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/solana-coin-investment-tips-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">Solana</a> is a layer-1 blockchain designed to host decentralized, scalable applications. It can process scores of transactions per second, that too, at lower transaction fees compared to its rival blockchains. It uses Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus to validate its transactions.</p>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/SOL-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">SOL</a> has unmatched potential as a profitable crypto investment if you are searching for crypto to buy today. Coin Price Forecast, a crypto forecast platform, predicts a promising run for SOL. It predicts SOL’s price will hit a whopping high of<a href="https://www.cryptonewsz.com/forecast/solana-price-prediction/" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"> $676 by the end of 2023</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>4. Cardano (ADA)</h2>



<p><em>Market Cap : $0.5745</em></p>



<p><em>Price : $19Bn</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-to-buy-cardano-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">Cardano</a> is a layer-1 protocol launched in 2017. ADA, Cardano&#8217;s native token, is<a href="https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-cardano#:~:text=Cardano%20is%20one%20of%20the,tokens%2C%20games%2C%20and%20more." rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"> one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization</a>. It provides high sustainability and security to decentralized systems and applications using state-of-the-art technologies. It aims to be the most environment-friendly and sustainable blockchain. </p>



<p>It uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus, called Ouroboros, contrary to the energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism used by major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin.</p>



<p>As per the Reddit community’s price forecast, the <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/ADA-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">ADA coin’s price</a> may reach almost double its current price, hitting a high of almost <a href="https://www.cryptonewsz.com/forecast/cardano-price-prediction/" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">$1.8 by the end of 2022</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>5. Tether (USDT)</h2>



<p><em>Market Cap: $75Bn&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Price: $0.9989</em></p>



<p>Owned by Ifinex &#8211; a Hong Kong-registered company that owns BitFinex as well &#8211;&nbsp; <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-to-buy-tether-usdt-coin-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">Tether</a> is a cryptocurrency stable coin. <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-to-buy-tether-usdt-coin-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">Stablecoins</a> are a type of cryptocurrency that approach a steady valuation via a peg to an underlying asset. It is the best crypto to buy today for investors who want to escape the volatility of the crypto market. </p>



<p>As of May 2022, Tether is the third-largest cryptocurrency and is based on the bitcoin blockchain. It was launched in 2014 and started trading in 2015&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ideally, the price of <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/USDT-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">USDT</a> remains, i.e., $1, as it is pegged to the US dollar in a 1:1 ratio constant. It is the largest stablecoin in existence. The price of<a href="https://currency.com/tether-usdt-price-prediction" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"> USDT will remain stable at around $1</a>, with a margin for minor errors.</p>



<h2>6. Ripple ( XRP )</h2>



<p><em>Market Cap: $20Bn</em></p>



<p><em>Price: $0.4303</em></p>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/XRP-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Ripple</a> was created with the sole goal of ensuring a high speed of money transfers. To keep track of information of the transactions, it uses a consensus registry, which differs from the classic blockchain.</p>



<p>The potential in XRP’s future, as indicated by various crypto forecast platforms, makes it a top contender of cryptocurrency to buy today. Experts predict a steady growth in the price valuation of the coin up till 2029 when it is expected to explode and<a href="https://changelly.com/blog/ripple-xrp-price-prediction/" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"> cross the $30 mark in 2031</a>.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>The crypto market has no doubt seen a few dips this month, but there is no lie in stating that cryptocurrency is here to stay.&nbsp; Be an informed investor and make a learned decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are looking for a safe, secure, and hassle-free trading platform, head to <a href="https://wazirx.com/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">WazirX</a> to enjoy a seamless and smooth trading experience.</p>

                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="800" src="https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Best-Nft-Marketplace-in-India-Why-Wazirx-is-the-best.png" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="Best Nft Marketplace in India Why Wazirx is the best" loading="lazy" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;" link_thumbnail="" srcset="https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Best-Nft-Marketplace-in-India-Why-Wazirx-is-the-best.png 1200w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Best-Nft-Marketplace-in-India-Why-Wazirx-is-the-best-300x200.png 300w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Best-Nft-Marketplace-in-India-Why-Wazirx-is-the-best-1024x683.png 1024w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Best-Nft-Marketplace-in-India-Why-Wazirx-is-the-best-768x512.png 768w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Best-Nft-Marketplace-in-India-Why-Wazirx-is-the-best-900x600.png 900w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Best-Nft-Marketplace-in-India-Why-Wazirx-is-the-best-174x116.png 174w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><div id="bsf_rt_marker">
<p>A non-fungible token (NFT) is a type of <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-defi/" data-wpel-link="internal">DeFi</a> token that can’t be substituted for another. Each NFT is unique and can be considered a “digital asset” that represents something tangible, such as a car or a house. NFTs can be used in various ways, such as to represent a digital copy of a piece of artwork, game items, tickets, and more.</p>



<p>To buy and sell NFTs, one needs to be registered with an <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-to-create-an-account-on-wazirx-nft-marketplace/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFT marketplace</a>. There are many options available in the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/blockchain-explained/" data-wpel-link="internal">blockchain</a> ecosystem. But what is an NFT marketplace, and what can it do? </p>



<p>An NFT Marketplace is a place where you can trade, sell, and buy Non-Fungible Tokens (<a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/a-guide-to-nfts/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFTs</a>). They can be both decentralized and centralized exchanges, much like crypto exchanges. In addition, you can use these NFT marketplaces to mint your own NFTs &#8211;  virtual collectibles or assets with real-world utilities.</p>



<h2>Choosing A Marketplace</h2>



<p>There are dozens of options available when it comes to choosing an <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-to-create-an-account-on-wazirx-nft-marketplace/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFT marketplace</a> to do your trading on. OpenSea, <a href="https://nft.wazirx.org/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">WazirX</a>, Bollycoin are such marketplaces. Each of these have their own features and quirks. How do you choose one to mint and trade NFTs on? Ideally, you should take a look at the marketplace’s offerings, trading volumes, fees, and features before deciding. </p>



<p>Most popular marketplaces are decentralized, meaning that a central authority does not control them. This makes it easier for you to mint and distribute your <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/a-guide-to-nfts/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFTs</a> if you’re a creator, and if you are a collector, it makes it easier to look for new NFT series and creators, all for a nominal fee. </p>



<p>Let’s take a look at some popular NFT marketplaces, and you can then decide which one is best suited for your needs.</p>



<h2>Blockparty</h2>



<p>Blockparty is an <a href="https://nft.wazirx.org/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">NFT marketplace</a> and storefront platform for creators and brands to mint and sell their NFTs. Their primary and secondary marketplaces support both fiat currency and crypto payments alongside bidding, as well as creator royalties. Later this year, storefronts on Blockparty will be embedded with the resale functionality, creating an eBay-like platform for NFTs.</p>



<h2>Jupiter Meta</h2>



<p>Jupiter Meta is an Indian <a href="https://nft.wazirx.org/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">NFT marketplace</a> based out of Chennai. Currently, it is working on the “Singara Chennai” project, which aims to showcase iconic Chennai destinations and items that include monuments, locations, food, places of worship, beaches, etc., as the background, while the foreground is taken up by a mix of elements that represent the past, the present, and the future.</p>



<h2>NFTX</h2>



<p>NFTX is a marketplace for creating a liquid market for illiquid NFTs. The user deposits the NFT in the NFTX vault and creates an alternative ERC20 token (vToken) that represents the vault&#8217;s invoice for random assets within. You can also use vToken to retrieve a specific NFT from the vault. Collectors can stake their NFTs to earn rewards, similar to how crypto is staked.</p>



<h2>Bollycoin</h2>



<p>Bollycoin is an ambitious project that aims to bring Bollywood enthusiasts over to crypto and NFTs by minting Bollywood-themed NFTs via community involvement and eventually gamification. In June of 2022, Bollycoin will launch its own metaverse, bringing these Bollywood-inspired NFTs to life. Since the community is an integral part of Bollycoin, the Bollywood community takes all decisions through a voting process, and all decisions are implemented on the DAO autonomously.</p>



<h2>OpenSea</h2>



<p>OpenSea is one of the biggest platforms when it comes to buying and selling NFTs. It operates on three blockchains for now: Ethereum, Polygon, and Klatyn. OpenSea allows extensive customization for independent storefronts and integration into your project. Secondary sales on OpenSea give the creator an option to set a royalty system, wherein each sale gives the original creator a set percentage of the profits.</p>



<h2>WazirX’s NFT Marketplace</h2>



<p>WazirX’s NFT Marketplace is a new addition to the blockchain ecosystem, brought to you by the team behind WazirX, the largest centralized crypto exchange in India. The <a href="https://nft.wazirx.org/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">WazirX NFT Marketplace</a> is built on the Binance Smart Chain blockchain. The BSC blockchain is faster than ETH and has comparatively lower gas fees. This makes it a better choice for NFT projects since transaction costs can be prohibitively expensive on the ETH chain. Also, it is possible for you to transfer your NFTs from one chain to another (multi-chain transfers) in case you need your NFTs on ETH for some reason.</p>



<p><a href="https://nft.wazirx.org/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">WazirX’s NFT Marketplace</a> is an excellent choice for both creators and collectors since its user-friendly and simplistic layout makes it easy to mint new collections, put them up for auctions, bid on NFTs, trade them, organize them, and more.</p>



<h3>For Creators</h3>



<p>Creators can drop their <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/the-pros-and-cons-of-nft-art/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFT</a> collections, no matter how big or small, on WazirX’s <a href="https://nft.wazirx.org/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">NFT</a> Marketplace. Any piece of digital art (GIFs, videos, audios, images) with a file size under 100MB can be minted as an NFT by creators. While minting your NFTs, all you need to do is upload the file, set your asking price in WRX, set the royalty, and you’re done. There are no fees to be paid other than gas fees.</p>



<p>Currently, WazirX’s NFT Marketplace is an invite-only platform. This means that only approved artists can become creators on the platform, which helps keep the quality of art on the Marketplace to a high standard. To get whitelisted, you must be invited by existing creators or verified collectors on the platform.</p>



<p>Alternatively, you will be automatically whitelisted if you’ve sold a certain amount of NFTs on Ethereum-based marketplaces such as OpenSea. To get whitelisted, simply connect your MetaMask wallet.</p>



<h3>For Collectors</h3>



<p>The only prerequisite for collectors to purchase NFTs on the platform is to own a MetaMask wallet and have it connected with their account on the <a href="https://nft.wazirx.org/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">WazirX NFT Marketplace</a>. There are no fees associated with buying an NFT. The only costs you have to pay are the cost of the NFT and the 5% commission, which goes to folks who work to verify the transactions on the blockchain.</p>



<p>There are two pricing models when it comes to NFTs on WazirX’s NFT Marketplace. The first is the most common, the fixed price model. In this model, the price of the NFT is fixed, and the buyer gets the NFT as soon as the payment is made. In the auction model, multiple collectors make bids on a particular NFT, and each bid must be 5% greater than the current highest bid within the auction period. The auction ends after the period expires or if the creator ends the auction early.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>As we’ve seen above, <a href="https://nft.wazirx.org/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">WazirX’s NFT Marketplace</a> is an excellent choice for NFT Marketplaces. Low gas fees, no extra fees, and an invite-only community all come together to make a great marketplace with no downsides. Hopefully, this post has helped you make the right choice in choosing a marketplace.</p>

<h2><strong>About CITY</strong></h2>



<p>Manchester City Fan Token is a fan token by Socios.com — an app built on the Chiliz (CHZ) blockchain. Socios has created fan tokens for several other football clubs, the most popular of them being (PSG), as well as fan tokens for UFC and car racing. Fan tokens give holders a stake in the club’s governance by allowing them to influence decisions, unlock VIP rewards, and access to exclusive promotions, games, and special recognition. Following the massive success of PSG’s launch in January 2020, Manchester City Football Club decided to launch CITY in March 2021. Its success will mainly depend on the club’s success on the pitch and the development of blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Staking cryptocurrencies is the process of committing your cryptocurrency assets to support a blockchain network and confirm transactions. It is compatible with cryptocurrencies that use the Proof-of-Stake model to process payments. This is a lower-energy and better variant of the original Proof-of-Work consensus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Proof-of-Stake is a consensus mechanism that allows users to stake their cryptocurrencies. Then, at random intervals, one of them is chosen to have the authority to authenticate the next block. The probability of being chosen increases with the number of coins staked. You have a better chance if you have more coins locked up.</p>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/crypto-staking-simplified/" data-wpel-link="internal">Staking</a> your cryptocurrency can be a great way to generate passive income, especially since some cryptocurrencies offer high-interest rates for staking. In staking, the token holders deposit – or lock away – a number of tokens in order to become active participants in the network&#8217;s operation. This way, they become &#8220;validators&#8221; (also known as &#8220;stakers&#8221;), whose role is to propose and verify new data that is added to the system. Let&#8217;s have a look at the 5 top staking coins to earn rewards in 2022.</p>



<h2>1. Cardano</h2>



<p>To verify transactions, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin use a Proof-of-Work, or PoW, model. Cardano employs a popular alternative form of verification known as Proof-of-Stake or PoS. Investors increase the chances of producing blocks by delegating Cardano&#8217;s native cryptocurrency <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/ADA-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">ADA</a> to a stake pool. When blocks are created, the pools earn rewards, which are then distributed to all pool contributors. Users have complete control over which pool they wish to join. They can also evaluate each one based on their previous performance, uptime, and pool size. Depending on how you stake <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/ADA-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Cardano</a>, you can earn anywhere from <a href="https://www.coruna.io/staking-with-stick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">over 1.9% to over 7%</a>, with 1.9% requiring very little investment.</p>



<h2>2. Solana</h2>



<p>Solana was one of 2021&#8217;s biggest crypto surprises. Using a Proof-of-Stake consensus, Solana secures the network through economic validators rather than miners. As a result, this staking mechanism allows you to earn rewards without the need for any hardware or money. To begin, <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/SOL-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">SOL tokens</a> in your wallet must be transferred to a stake account. You can open as many stake accounts as you want and deposit as much or as little <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/SOL-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">SOL</a> as you want into each one. Each new stake account has its own address, and a single wallet can manage or &#8220;authorize&#8221; multiple stake accounts.</p>



<p>As more token holders choose to stake their SOL tokens across the network and the total amount of stake on the network grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for even a well-coordinated and well-funded attacker to single-handedly change the outcome of a consensus vote for their own benefit.</p>



<p>You can stake your tokens by delegating them to validators, who process transactions and run the network. It is a shared-risk, shared-reward financial model that may provide long-term returns to token holders. Returns/yield for staked tokens are determined by the current inflation rate, the total number of SOL staked on the network, and the uptime and commission of an individual validator.</p>



<h2>3. Ethereum</h2>



<p>Staking Ethereum means depositing 32 <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/ETH-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">ETH</a> in order to activate validator software. Broadly speaking, during each round of validation, the PoS-powered blockchain bundles 32 blocks of transactions. This process takes an average of 6.4 minutes. These block bundles are referred to as &#8220;epochs.&#8221; You will be in charge of storing data, processing transactions, and adding new blocks to the blockchain as a validator. This will keep Ethereum secure for everyone while also earning you new ETH. Beacon chain has introduced the PoS (Proof-of-Stake) protocol for Ethereum.</p>



<p>When the validation round occurs, the Beacon Chain selects 128 validators at random and forms a committee. For data processing, each committee is assigned a unique shard. Each epoch has 32 slots, each of which requires one committee to process the data, i.e., each epoch is created by 32 committees. Actions that aid the network in reaching consensus are rewarded. You&#8217;ll be rewarded for batching transactions into a new block or double-checking the work of other validators because this is what keeps the chain secure.</p>



<h2>4. Binance</h2>



<p>Binance has one of the highest trade volumes in the cryptocurrency market. <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/BNB-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">BNB</a> is the native cryptocurrency of Binance. To stake <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/BNB-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Binance Coin</a> (BNB), you must have at least 1 BNB, and all of your coins must be on the Binance Chain. Every day, the BNB holders can help choose the validator(s) on the network and be rewarded for helping secure the network to make the network more decentralized. Delegating BNB to a validator or multiple validators on the Binance Chain is the process of staking BNB.</p>



<p>Validators on the Binance Chain are compensated by their delegators. The commission percentage is calculated by summing all delegated BNB minus the BNB that is self-staked by the validator and then multiplying by the commission percentage. Validators receive 100% of their self-staked rewards.</p>



<h2>5. Cosmos</h2>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/ATOM-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Cosmos</a> (ATOM) is a cryptocurrency that powers an ecosystem of blockchains that are designed to scale and communicate with one another. The team&#8217;s goal is to &#8220;<em>create an Internet of Blockchains, a network of decentralized blockchains capable of communicating with one another</em>.&#8221; Cosmos uses Proof-of-Stake consensus.</p>



<p>Staking your ATOM is an excellent way to generate passive income through staking rewards. ATOM is used to payout rewards. You can think of it as earning interest in your cryptocurrency holdings. Staking in Cosmos means agreeing to lock up a certain amount of your <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/ATOM-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">ATOM</a> for a set period of time during which it is unspendable. You can, however, unlock your ATOM whenever you want.</p>



<p>You actively support the Cosmos network by allocating resources to it by staking your ATOM. Staking also contributes to the network&#8217;s stability. As a reward for your assistance, you will receive more ATOM. The Cosmos validators are responsible for validating and approving transactions on the Cosmos blockchain. The more ATOM they are delegated, the more transactions they can validate and the more powerful they become. You basically &#8220;vote&#8221; for them and show your trust in them by delegating your tokens to them.</p>



<p>The greater the number of transactions validated by a validator, the more money they earn. They return the earned rewards to those who delegated their ATOM to them. This is how you make your money. You can stake any amount of ATOM and begin earning rewards right away. During this time, you will be able to conduct transactions only with the unspent amount of <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/ATOM-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">ATOM</a> in your wallet.</p>



<p>Many <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/top-cryptocurrencies-to-consider-for-long-term-investments/" data-wpel-link="internal">long-term cryptocurrency</a> investors see staking as a way to put their assets to work for them by generating rewards rather than just sitting in their crypto wallets collecting dust. Staking also helps to secure and optimize the blockchain projects you support. Staking some of your funds increases the blockchain&#8217;s resistance to attacks and its ability to process transactions. Some projects also give staking participants &#8220;governance tokens,&#8221; which give holders a right to present their stand in future protocol changes and upgrades. </p>



<p><br>You can calculate your staking rewards for the cryptocurrencies listed above and many more <a href="https://www.stakingrewards.com/calculator/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

<p>The year 2021 was phenomenal for the global crypto markets for a number of reasons. While crypto adoption across the globe grew exponentially, the crypto market capitalization touched new highs. El Salvador accepting Bitcoin as a legal tender might have earmarked the beta phase of future cryptocurrency payment systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the event that guaranteed cryptocurrency’s entry into the mainstream happened in October &#8211; the launch of the first cryptocurrency ETF &#8211; Proshares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), on the NYSE<strong> </strong>(New York Stock Exchange). The Proshares ETF garnered investments worth a billion within two days of its launch. </p>



<p>While ETFs have been quite popular with investors in the traditional stock market, the journey of the first-ever Proshares crypto ETF has been very long, given the regulatory concerns around cryptos. <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/bitcoin-etf/" data-wpel-link="internal">ETFs</a> are becoming a global phenomenon taking up an even larger share of global investments than before. A Bloomberg report states that crypto investments rose from<a href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/cryptocurrency/explained--all-you-need-to-know-about-crypto-etfs-12753822.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"> $24 billion in 2020 to $63 billion in 2021</a>, recording a jump of 162%. Let’s discuss what a crypto ETF is, the history behind the first-ever crypto ETF, how to buy crypto ETF, the best crypto ETF in India, and much more.  </p>



<h2>What is a crypto ETF?</h2>



<p>A cryptocurrency exchange-traded fund or crypto ETF is a fund that consists of cryptocurrencies. Conventional ETFs track a particular index or a basket of assets. Similarly, crypto ETFs follow the movement of one or more digital assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ETFs are traded on exchanges on a daily basis, just like stocks or cryptos. The value or price of crypto ETF fluctuates daily depending on the changes in investor sales or purchases. ETFs are one of the easiest ways via which investors who are wary of the volatile crypto markets can gain exposure to a selected basket of cryptos. Crypto ETFs are traded on exchanges via a brokerage service.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Kinds of ETF&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Crypto ETFs work in a fashion similar to traditional ETFs that are asset-backed. ETFs operate in two ways. Based on their working, ETFs can be of two kinds:</p>



<p><strong>Physical-backed ETF:</strong> ETFs backed by physical cryptocurrencies come under this category. The firm that manages the ETF invests in cryptocurrencies. Ownership in this kind of ETF is in the form of shares. When investors purchase shares in this ETF, they indirectly own cryptocurrencies. They get exposure to cryptos without incurring the actual costs or bearing the associated risks.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Futures-backed ETF: </strong>This type of ETF synthetically tracks the prices of <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/top-cryptocurrencies-you-should-buy-and-hold-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">cryptocurrencies</a> via cryptocurrency derivatives like futures contracts and exchange-traded products (ETPs). Many ETFs proposed to the US SEC track the bitcoin futures contracts listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). For example, the Proshares ETF tracks the price movements of bitcoin futures. <strong> </strong></p>



<p>This ETF tracks and mimics the price movements of cryptocurrency derivatives; hence, the price of its shares rises with the price of futures contract prices and vice versa. Futures-backed ETFs are considered less transparent and riskier than physical-backed ETFs.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Timeline: The Regulatory Status of Crypto ETFs</h2>



<ul><li>After approximately five years, when Bitcoin had begun trading on an exchange, the Winklevoss twins filed a proposal for a crypto ETF with the SEC in 2014.&nbsp;</li><li>The application was rejected and was followed by a number of similar applications from investment firms, including another application from the Winklevoss twins. None of the applications was accepted then.&nbsp;</li><li>The flurry of rejections from the SEC had its roots in the concerns elucidated in a letter by the SEC in 2018, which included lack of transparency at exchanges, the scope of market manipulation, and low liquidity in crypto markets.&nbsp;</li><li>The situation has tremendously changed since the SEC&#8217;s 2018 letter. With trading volumes multiplied at the exchanges, the market touched the $3 trillion capitalization in 2021.&nbsp;</li><li>Coinbase Global Inc. became a publicly traded entity on NASDAQ.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>The twins filed an application again in 2021 and the SEC recorded receiving at least 12 applications for ETFs seeking to profit from Bitcoin’s price volatility.&nbsp;</li><li>There is hope for a change in the SEC&#8217;s stance. Former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton was replaced by CFTC chief Gary Gensler recently. While Clayton was hostile to cryptocurrencies, Gensler used to teach a course in blockchain and cryptocurrencies at MIT.&nbsp;</li><li>The first crypto ETF by Proshares started trading in October 2021.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2>Benefits of Crypto ETFs</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-important-is-marketing-in-the-crypto-space/" data-wpel-link="internal">crypto market</a> is still in its nascence, with Bitcoin entering its first teenage year. Given the regulatory uncertainty and volatile crypto market, Crypto ETFs are considered a nascent asset class. Despite this, they can be one of the best instruments to own cryptocurrencies:</p>



<p><strong>Low costs</strong>: Crypto ETFs allow owners to own ETF shares at a fraction of the price of actual crypto. Physical ownership is accompanied by other additional expenses, such as custody charges, annual wallet fees, etc. Whereas other hidden charges, such as network fees and transaction charges, add to the costs of directly owning cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Backdoor Entry Route</strong>: Besides the low costs of ownership, ETFs provide access to a wide array of cryptocurrencies. The investors can benefit from their price fluctuations without getting exposed to the market volatility as the risk is now spread across the basket of cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Easy Access</strong>: ETFs being a conventional mode of investment, accord trust among investors, while blockchain and cryptos being fairly new concepts, invite apprehension. Additionally, crypto jargon has a steep learning curve, and the difficulty in understanding the scope and working of cryptocurrencies is a roadblock to their mass adoption. With ETFs, investors can skip the learning curve and easily invest in ETFs via brokers and exchanges.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Infrastructural Roadblocks</strong>: The crypto exchanges sell thousands of cryptocurrencies, but the prevailing infrastructure underpinning the security and transparency at these exchanges is still undeveloped. While for buying different cryptocurrencies, the costs incurred for each would be separate. ETFs, help investors to diversify their investments without incurring additional costs.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>&nbsp;Best Crypto ETFs to buy in 2022</h2>



<p>Besides the Proshares Bitcoin ETF, there are several successful ETF-like products in which investors can put their money, including Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), Bitwise Ethereum Fund, Bitwise UniSwap Fund, etc. These ETF-like products invest in cryptocurrencies on behalf of the investors but are available to only investment firms, accredited investors, and high net worth individuals. Mainstream investors have no access to such funds but can buy several crypto ETFs listed on the exchanges worldwide. Here’s a list of the best ETF to buy in March 2022 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/best-blockchain-etfs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">(Forbes):</a> </p>



<ul><li>Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ)</li><li>Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH)</li><li>Siren Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF (BLCN)</li><li>Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK)</li><li>First Trust SkyBridge Crypto Industry and Digital Economy ETF (CRPT)</li><li>VanEck Digital Transformation ETF (DAPP)</li><li>Capital Link Global Fintech Leaders ETF (KOIN)</li><li>First Trust Innovative Transaction &amp; Process ETF (LEGR)</li></ul>



<p>As discussed earlier, since crypto ETFs are still an evolving class, the options available in the market are limited. And since they mimic cryptocurrency prices, they are bound to experience volatility. Investors who are interested in cryptos as an investment but aren’t able to enter the markets directly can place their bets on cryptos via ETFs and revel in the most rewarding and fast-developing asset class on the investment scene currently.</p>

<p>Decentralization, trustless interactions, high degrees of security, and immutable record-keeping are advantages of blockchain technology. As a result, it has aided the growth of a thriving cryptocurrency ecosystem while supporting constant technical progress. However, scalability is one of the major issues with many blockchain networks. When the volume of data passing via the blockchain reaches a limit due to the blockchain&#8217;s limited capacity, scaling issues arise.</p>



<p>This blog will get an overview of the Layer 2 scaling solution that brought a revolution in the Blockchain world.</p>



<h2>First things first: What is Blockchain scalability?</h2>



<p>A <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/blockchain-and-the-future-of-voting/" data-wpel-link="internal">blockchain</a>, in an ideal world processes, a limitless number of transactions per second, often known as throughput or TPS (Transactions per second). On the other hand, the Bitcoin main chain can only handle 3-7 TPS. Developers are working to broaden the scope of what a blockchain can achieve to meet these concerns. Consequently, more transactions may be processed per second, and processing times can be reduced.</p>



<p>Scalability is essential because it is the only way for blockchain networks to compete on an equal footing with older, centralized systems that provide faster settlement times. Using Layer-2 scaling techniques is one option.</p>



<p>What are we waiting for? Let&#8217;s deep dive into the Layer-2 scaling solutions.</p>



<h2>An introduction to Layer-2 scaling solution</h2>



<p>Layer-2 is a network or system that runs on top of a blockchain protocol to increase scalability and efficiency. This scaling solution involves offloading a portion of a blockchain protocol&#8217;s transactional weight to an adjacent system architecture, which then performs the majority of the network&#8217;s processing and only reports back to the main blockchain to complete the process. As a result, the base layer blockchain becomes less crowded — and eventually more scalable — by extracting the majority of data processing to supplementary architecture.</p>



<p>Bitcoin, for example, is a Layer-1 network, and the Lightning Network is a Layer-2 solution created to enhance transaction speeds on the Bitcoin network in this way.</p>



<h2>Need for a Layer-2 scaling solution</h2>



<p>Layer 2 solutions are required because they provide scalability and greater throughput. In addition, they maintain the Ethereum blockchain&#8217;s integrity, allowing for total <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/growth-of-decentralized-finance-defi/" data-wpel-link="internal">decentralization</a>, transparency, and security while also lowering carbon emissions (less gas means less energy used, which equates to less carbon.)</p>



<p>Even though the Ethereum blockchain is the most commonly used and most secure, it does have flaws. The Ethereum Mainnet is famous for its prolonged transaction speeds (13 per second) and high gas prices. On top of the Ethereum blockchain, Layer 2s maintains transactions safe, fast, and scalable.</p>



<p>Each system has its own set of benefits and disadvantages, including throughput, gas costs, security, scalability, and, of course, functionality. At the moment, no one layer 2 solutions can meet all of these requirements. However, layer 2 scaling techniques called rollups try to enhance all of these qualities.</p>



<h2>A quick introduction to Layer-1 scaling solution</h2>



<p>A Layer-1 network is a blockchain in the decentralized ecosystem, whereas a Layer-2 protocol is a third-party integration that may be combined with a Layer-1 blockchain. Layer-1 blockchains include Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum, for example. Furthermore, layer-1 scaling solutions supplement the blockchain protocol&#8217;s foundation layer to boost scalability.</p>



<h2>How do the Layer-2 scaling solutions work?</h2>



<p>Layers 1 and 2 are linked, and a summary of Layer-2 transactions is transferred to Layer 1 at regular intervals for archival purposes. Therefore, layer-2 networks must consider how transactions are validated before they are &#8220;cast in concrete&#8221; on the main chain.</p>



<p>It entails offloading a portion of a blockchain protocol&#8217;s transactional weight to an adjacent system architecture, which handles most of the network&#8217;s processing and only reports back to the main blockchain when it&#8217;s finished. By extracting the majority of data processing to supplementary architecture, the base layer blockchain becomes less congested – and eventually more scalable.</p>



<p>Instead of transmitting every transaction via Layer 1, it aims to handle these transactions on a parallel blockchain known as &#8220;Layer-2&#8221; to avoid congestion.</p>



<h2>Final words</h2>



<p>Layer-2 solutions are important because they enable better scalability and throughput while retaining the Ethereum blockchain&#8217;s integrity, allowing for full decentralization, transparency, and security while reducing carbon emissions.</p>



<p>Even while no one Layer-2 solution currently meets all of these criteria, they continue to attempt to improve all of them.</p>

<p>Mark Yusko, CEO and Founder of Morgan Creek Capital says that the web 3.0 internet will have its own protocol stack consisting of several blockchain networks, just like the web 2.0 protocol stack. The “trust net” that blockchain and cryptocurrency interweave will generate much more wealth than Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 taken together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The growth of decentralized networks that slowly picked up post the Defi summer of 2020 has reached exponential levels as <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/web-3-0-the-internet-of-money-explained/" data-wpel-link="internal">web3 is steps away from becoming a reality</a>. Defi-based protocols and those supporting web3 applications are witnessing a surge in prices and market capitalization, and there can be no time better than now to start placing your bets on these cryptos than in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a list of the top web3 cryptocurrencies in 2022 from the top cryptocurrency list that might explode or see exponential gains in 2022:&nbsp;</p>



<h2>#1 Ethereum (ETH)</h2>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-ethereum/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum</a> remains at the top of the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-defi/" data-wpel-link="internal">Defi</a> game, with the largest number of web3-based platforms, <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/a-guide-to-nfts/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFTs</a>, and dApps hosted over its network. Moreover, it has the highest number of smart contracts ever created on any decentralized network and hence, tops our list of top web 3.0 cryptocurrencies in India in 2022. Although Ethereum suffers from high gas fees and low transaction throughput, things will take a turn once the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-ethereum-2-0/" data-wpel-link="internal">ETH 2.0</a> upgrade goes fully live.</p>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/ETH-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Ethereum</a> seeks to combat its scalability issues via a slew of L1 and L2 scaling solutions. Furthermore, post-ETH 2.0 upgrade, Ethereum will transcend from the current Proof-of-Work consensus to the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Ethereum is the largest altcoin and the number 2 cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $237.41 billion as of 18 May 2022. </p>



<h2>#2 Helium (HNT)</h2>



<p>The decentralized network was launched in 2019 as a blockchain for IoT devices. The <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/HNT-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">helium</a> network consists of hotspots or network nodes that combine a wireless gateway and a blockchain mining device. The users who participate in the network by setting up hotspots get rewarded in the <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/HNT-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">HNT token</a>. The hotspots are 200x more powerful than conventional wifi. </p>



<p>Helium seeks to improve IoT communication while eliminating the inadequacies in the current internet infrastructure. Many mainstream companies, such as Lime and Mousetrap, use the network to keep a tab on their connected devices. There are over 500,000 helium hotspots worldwide, and the numbers are increasing in thousands daily. At #58 rank in the top cryptocurrency list, Helium is positioned as a viable part of the web3 stack in the coming years. Its market capitalization is $97.34 million as of 18 May 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>#3 Polkadot (DOT)</h2>



<p>The 11th coin in the top cryptocurrency list, <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-polkadot/" data-wpel-link="internal">Polkadot</a>, was founded in 2016 as an open-source sharded multi-chain network enabling the cross-blockchain transfer of any type of data or asset type. Polkadot is paramount to the web3 internet and has been designed specifically to add the interoperability factor to the multi-chain world of web3. It is a layer-0 metaprotocol that operates on a network of layer-1 blockchains called parachains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December, five parachains were running simultaneously on the metaprotocol when Pokadot’s price reached an all-time high. As more parachains are added to its relay chain, we can expect Polkadot prices to explode in 2022. Polkadot has a market capitalization of $9.90 billion as of 18 May 2022.</p>



<h2>#4 BitTorrent</h2>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/BTTC-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">BitTorrent</a>, as a P2P file-sharing platform, holds great relevance in the upcoming decentralized era of web3, especially because it seeks the subversion of traditional centralized file storage systems that are costly and often suffer from censorship. With a network of 170 million monthly users, BitTorrent is one of the top web3 cryptocurrencies in India. </p>



<p>TRON acquired <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/BTTC-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">BitTorrent</a> in 2018. It is both a protocol and network implementation that allows P2P utilities to store and share digital content with the users. The <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/BTTC-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">BTT</a> network serves clients such as uTorrent Web, BitTorrent Web, and uTorrent classic. Users can access premium services such as VPN capabilities and ad-free browsing as paid options. BitTorrent is ranked at the 211th position in the top cryptocurrency list and has a market capitalization of $1.27 billion as of 18 May 2022. </p>



<h2>#5 The Graph (GRT)</h2>



<p>As web3 internet scales with time, The Graph usage will gather more steam as a significant part of the web3 protocol stack. The <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/GRT-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Graph</a> is an indexing protocol for organizing and querying data for Ethereum, IPFS, POA, and other decentralized networks that host Defi and web3-based applications. Since the 2020 Defi summer, The Graph has witnessed phenomenal growth at over 50% MoM and is an apt choice for top web3 cryptocurrencies in 2022 in India. </p>



<p>Over 3,000 subgraphs are already deployed on the network for dApps like Synrhetix, AAVE, Aragon, Livepeer, DAOstack, etc. Users can earn indexing rewards and query fees by staking their GRT tokens.&nbsp; The Graph ranks #52 in the top cryptocurrency list and has a market cap of $1.13 billion as of 18 May 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>#6 Chainlink (LINK)</h2>



<p>Launched in 2017, <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/LINK-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">ChainLink</a> has seen considerable growth as a decentralized network allowing integration of off-chain data into smart contracts. Chainlink lets blockchain access real-world data via the use of decentralized oracles. The network finds use cases in a wide spectrum of industries ranging from insurance and securities to payments and supply chain management &#8211; particularly where proof of events and data stamps are needed. </p>



<p>With Defi and the web3 boom adding more fuel to the altcoin market, Chainlink can surely be considered as one of the top web3 cryptos in India in 2022. Many conventional players in the data processing field today have adopted Chainlink. Data providers monetize their content by selling access to their data directly to the network. The layer-2 protocol also allows holders to earn staking rewards. <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/LINK-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Chainlink</a> has a market capitalization of $3.28 billion and is ranked #25 in the top cryptocurrency list as of 18 May 2022. </p>



<h2>#7 Theta (THETA)</h2>



<p>Another competent candidate for the web 3.0 cryptocurrency list, Theta, is a decentralized network that facilitates bandwidth and computer power sharing via a peer-to-peer network. Theta was founded in 2017 as a decentralized video streaming platform. It allows users to access and stream excellent video quality over a network of hundreds of computers worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/blockchain-explained/" data-wpel-link="internal">blockchain</a> has struck partnerships with several big firms, including MGM, NASA, and Lionsgate. The network is conducting airdrops and is launching an NFT-based video platform in 2022. <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/THETA-BTC" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Theta</a> is gaining traction as one of India&#8217;s top web 3.0 cryptocurrencies in 2022, with a market capitalization of  $1.24 billion. It is ranked 47th on the top <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/the-future-of-cryptocurrency-in-india-10-faqs-answered/" data-wpel-link="internal">cryptocurrency</a> list as of 18 May 2022. </p>



<p>As a trader seeking fortunes in cryptocurrencies, it is pertinent that we do our research before we begin investing in <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/top-cryptocurrencies-you-should-buy-and-hold-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">cryptocurrencies</a>.

Here are four simple steps to follow to protect your valuable NFTs.]]></description>
                <content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="800" src="https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/How-to-Protect-Your-NFTs.png" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="How to Protect Your NFTs" loading="lazy" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;" link_thumbnail="" srcset="https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/How-to-Protect-Your-NFTs.png 1200w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/How-to-Protect-Your-NFTs-300x200.png 300w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/How-to-Protect-Your-NFTs-1024x683.png 1024w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/How-to-Protect-Your-NFTs-768x512.png 768w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/How-to-Protect-Your-NFTs-900x600.png 900w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/How-to-Protect-Your-NFTs-174x116.png 174w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><div id="bsf_rt_marker">
<p>As the NFT space has grown in prominence, it has also become a more appealing target for hackers and scammers looking to profit from the huge reward potential and lack of regulations. These scams are further exacerbated by the hype surrounding the metaverse and NFTs, which have all sizes and types of organizations rushing to launch new platforms without putting adequate safeguards in place.</p>



<p>Thanks to the inherent security of blockchain, it is highly unlikely that anyone will lose their assets via a blockchain-level hack, but there are a growing number of other scams concerning fake NFTs, inflation of prices by traders who sell <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-to-create-an-account-on-wazirx-nft-marketplace/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFTs</a> to themselves, bugs that allow attackers to get massive discounts on popular NFTs, the growing use of NFTs for money laundering, and so on. This means that you can lose your <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/top-things-you-should-know-before-minting-your-first-nfts/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFTs</a> even if you don&#8217;t explicitly get robbed. </p>



<p> In this article, we will look at four simple ways to protect your NFTs.</p>



<h3>1. Create complex credentials</h3>



<p>In order to make it more difficult for hackers to guess your login credentials, you should ideally use a combination of capital letters, numbers, and symbols. It&#8217;s also critical to keep your credentials private and avoid texting or emailing them to anyone. Keeping credentials and passwords in a physical format is the best option if you need to maintain them in one place. Use a secure password manager, or write it down on paper and hide it somewhere like a safe deposit box. It&#8217;s possible to prevent a data breach and reduce the chance of someone gaining access to your <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/top-things-you-should-know-before-minting-your-first-nfts/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFTs</a> by keeping them offline.</p>



<h3>2. Use offline storage</h3>



<p>Avoid storing your <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/a-guide-to-nfts/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFTs</a> in a custodial wallet. Even centralized systems are vulnerable to hacks, so it&#8217;s better to keep your digital assets offline, especially if you don&#8217;t need to sell them or trade them immediately. Instead, invest in a hardware wallet, which forces you to sign every transaction manually, preventing anyone from accessing your funds remotely. You must, however, take full responsibility for your security, which usually entails backing up and storing your seed phrases and private keys in a secure location. You should also avoid keeping all your crypto assets and NFT assets in the same wallet.</p>



<h3>3. Avoid scammers and copycat websites</h3>



<p>It is more common for scammers to pose as influential people so that they can gain your trust and obtain your personal information. Likewise, beware of bogus sites that look exactly like the real ones, but when you try to mint, your wallet security gets compromised, and you lose your money. Be careful when dealing with <a href="https://nft.wazirx.org/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">NFT</a> transfers; never follow links from unofficial channels, and make sure the person you are speaking with is who they claim to be.</p>



<h3>4. Ensure the credibility of your marketplace</h3>



<p>The marketplace you choose must be both safe and reputable. You can verify this by reviewing their public audits, which ensure that their smart contracts are bug-free and safe for use. However, this may be more difficult to find on newer platforms, so it would be best to stick with the established <a href="https://nft.wazirx.org/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">NFT</a> marketplaces. While it&#8217;s certainly worth testing out new platforms, especially if there are significant incentives or reward potential, it&#8217;s always a good idea to be cautious. Before committing to a platform, especially if it&#8217;s new, do your homework, be wary of anything that seems unusual, and take the necessary precautions to keep yourself safe.</p>



<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>



<p>Scammers are constantly coming up with new and inventive ways to deceive people. Undoubtedly, the <a href="https://nft.wazirx.org/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">NFT</a> space has opened up exciting new opportunities and life-changing advantages. However, the space is also fraught with significant threats. Inexperienced people might have trouble avoiding these scams since they are often targeted because they are easy prey. However, following the rules mentioned above will dramatically reduce your risk of falling victim to fraud.</p>



<p><br>Looking for a safe, secure, and established NFT marketplace? WazirX NFT has got you covered. The most trusted marketplace for artists and creators in the country, <a href="https://nft.wazirx.org/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">WazirX NFT</a> is your best choice for NFT trading.

<p>Non-fungible tokens, or <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-nft-minting/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFTs</a>, are unique digital assets and cannot be replicated or duplicated. Unlike traditional digital collectibles, NFTs are stored on the blockchain and are completely decentralized. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ether, NFTs represent unique digital items. NFTs can be used in a variety of ways, including video game items such as weapons or characters. </p>



<p>Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, NFTs do not simply represent a single unit of currency. NFTs are decentralized and are issued by the community through a process known as “minting.”.</p>



<h2>What Is Minting?</h2>



<p>To understand how <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/top-things-you-should-know-before-minting-your-first-nfts/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFT minting</a> works, it is first helpful to understand how traditional cryptocurrencies are mined. A blockchain is a digital ledger that records transactions across a network. In order to create new units of a cryptocurrency, users must “mine” new coins. Miners are users who dedicate computing power to the network to verify transactions and add them to the blockchain.</p>



<p>The process of <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/top-things-you-should-know-before-minting-your-first-nfts/" data-wpel-link="internal">minting NFTs</a> is a unique feature of the blockchain. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, where an authority generates new coins, NFTs are minted or created by the community through a process known as “minting.” Each NFT represents a unique digital item, and to mint an NFT, a user must submit a digital object to the NFT’s blockchain. The digital object is then stored in the blockchain, and the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/blockchain-explained/" data-wpel-link="internal">blockchain</a> holds the digital object until the user claims it.</p>



<h2>How Can You Mint NFTs?</h2>



<p>Before minting an <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/top-things-you-should-know-before-minting-your-first-nfts/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFT</a>, you need to be aware of the three factors that influence your minting: the blockchain, the NFT marketplace, and the costs. Each of these is important and can be the difference between success and failure.</p>



<h3>Blockchain</h3>



<p>The <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/blockchain-explained/" data-wpel-link="internal">blockchain</a> you choose will determine the gas fees paid by you while minting the NFT. <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-ethereum/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum</a>, Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot, <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-tron/" data-wpel-link="internal">Tron</a>, Tezos, and many more chains now support NFTs, each with their own quirks. Most NFTs are minted on Ethereum, where the gas fees fluctuate with energy demands and network availability. Ethereum can be quite expensive, and Binance Smart Chain is a cheaper alternative with faster transaction speeds.</p>



<h3>NFT Marketplace</h3>



<p>The majority of reputable <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-to-create-an-account-on-wazirx-nft-marketplace/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFT marketplaces</a> have a mandatory vetting process for NFT sellers, and these vetting processes make your assets appear more trustworthy, drawing more customers. For example, platforms like Rarible and Foundation. Curated and invite-only marketplaces are some of the more elite platforms for both artists and collectors, such as <a href="https://nft.wazirx.org/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">WazirX’s brand new NFT marketplace</a>. This aura of exclusivity ensures that only high-quality art and unique digital assets are allowed on the platform, making themselves a one-stop shop for serious NFT collectors.</p>



<h3>Cost</h3>



<p>The costs of minting an NFT depend on the chosen platform and blockchain. For example, some platforms let you mint NFTs for free and pass on the gas fees to the buyer. This model is suitable for mass-produced NFT collections, but a single, one-time fee is a better option for smaller collections.</p>



<p>After you’ve chosen your <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/blockchain-explained/" data-wpel-link="internal">blockchain</a>, marketplace, and costs, the next step is to publish your NFTs and put them up for trade on the marketplace of your choice.</p>



<h2>Trading Your NFTs</h2>



<p>Trading your NFTs is an important part of the NFT ecosystem and often the most enticing aspect of it. Trading NFTs has its own set of requirements, namely a valid wallet and a marketplace compatible with the wallet. If your chosen blockchain is a new and obscure entry to the market, chances are that it is not going to be present in any of the major wallets. That is why it is recommended that you pick well-known blockchains, even if obscure ones are better optimized to your preferences. With the integration of multi-chain, the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/blockchain-explained/" data-wpel-link="internal">blockchain</a> requirements will be obsolete, but it is important to bear this in mind until then.</p>



<p>With a wallet linked to the marketplace, you can now successfully trade your NFTs to others for the cryptocurrency that’s built on the NFT’s blockchain. If you haven’t published your NFT via a third-party marketplace, a few wallets also offer an NFT section, which lets you transfer NFTs with ease.</p>



<h2>Security</h2>



<p>As NFTs are still in a developing stage, there are a few risks associated with investing in them, such as fraud, phishing, etc. The best way to keep your assets secure is to either invest in a hardware wallet for cold storage or to only trade NFTs through trusted third-party marketplaces such as OpenSea, WazirX, and others.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>We have covered everything you need to know to get started with NFTs and more in this post. We hope it helps you get started. As the NFT ecosystem matures over the incoming years, the addition of P2E games, NFT entry tickets, and other use cases will turn this fledgling technology into the forerunner of Web 3.0.</p>

<p>If you were an early crypto enthusiast, you might recall the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) craze of 2017, which opened the way for a few successful ventures and a slew of frauds. As a democratic crowdfunding platform, it lets ICO people raise funds for their forthcoming blockchain ventures.</p>



<p>Many investors were eager to participate in as many rounds as possible, expecting that the value of their ICO tokens would gradually explode. Unfortunately, although the price of a few currencies eventually increased, the bulk of ICO projects failed.</p>



<p>Before making a purchase, investors and consumers assess various aspects while evaluating a project&#8217;s Initial <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/top-shitcoins-to-buy-today/" data-wpel-link="internal">Coin</a> Offering (ICO). The hard cap &amp; soft cap of an ICO are the most well-known among them. A hard cap is the entire amount a company hopes to raise in an ICO, whereas a soft cap is a minimum amount necessary for developers to launch their product.</p>



<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll look at what are hard caps and soft caps and the importance of hard caps in the crypto-verse.</p>



<h2>Hard cap: Definition</h2>



<p>The hard cap of a project refers to the highest amount of money the team hopes to raise in return for its tokens during the early funding stages. As a result, when a project reaches a hard cap during an ICO fundraising campaign, it implies that the tokens for that round have sold out. In essence, the team has met its aim of raising cash through an ICO and will no longer take funds from investors in return for project tokens.</p>



<h2>Soft cap: Definition</h2>



<p>On the other side, the soft cap is the lowest amount that may be raised in an ICO fundraising event. It&#8217;s the polar opposite of the hard cap, as teams compete for the smallest amount of funds feasible to keep the project going. If a team does not raise enough money to reach its soft cap, it usually returns the money to investors, but some ventures continue to operate with whatever cash they have.</p>



<h2>Importance of a hard cap</h2>



<ul><li><strong>Creating Scarcity</strong></li></ul>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/the-next-bitcoin-halving-when-what-and-how/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>, the world&#8217;s first cryptocurrency, is valued due to its restricted quantity, among other factors. As most crypto enthusiasts know, the market will never have more than 21 million BTC.</p>



<p>Any effort to impose a hard cap must adhere to supply and demand fundamentals. The notion is highly similar to what we see in the art sector if you think about it.</p>



<p>Corporate executives and team members must strike a careful balance to get this number right. The value of tokens falls in general when the quantity of tokens grows, and vice versa.</p>



<p>This theory underpins the deflationary tokens category, a popular blockchain technology.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Being Practical</strong></li></ul>



<p>The hard cap is inextricably linked to the project&#8217;s roadmap. Therefore, during each offering phase, the team should always define the goal of the money collected.</p>



<p>Consider a project that offers incremental improvements while observing market enthusiasm (just like, for example, meme coins). In this instance, the team may struggle to deal with such a large sum of money at once.</p>



<p>The hard cap restriction might aid teams in managing cash flow on a new project.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Limiting Whales</strong></li></ul>



<p>Speculators may decide to invest a large sum of money in a new business only to dump the coins after the initial coin offering (ICO). These &#8220;whales&#8221; might jeopardize a project&#8217;s reputation, resulting in massive price swings in the near term.</p>



<p>The team can use the hard cap technique to keep wealthy speculators away from its token.</p>



<h2>Bottom line</h2>



<p>To summarize, the distinction between a hard cap and a soft cap in the crypto world is that a hard cap is the highest amount of money an aspiring crypto project plans to raise for its development needs. In contrast, a soft cap in crypto denotes the minimum amount of funds required to continue working on the project.</p>

<p>The movement behind crypto is gaining momentum, and everyone wants to get on this train! This is especially true for Bollywood celebrities and other artists looking to offer something more to their fans. The usual route is to provide some sort of merchandise such as t-shirts and fashion accessories. Now, however, these influencers are looking at new-age routes like using Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)! How deep does this trend go? Which celebrities have taken this step? Let’s find out below.</p>



<h1><strong>Bollywood celebs x NFT</strong></h1>



<p>Non-fungible tokens are, to put it simply, digital assets that are hosted on the blockchain because of which their digital trail and authenticity can be confirmed. A layman can think of it as pieces of art that exist virtually, but the origin and authenticity can be verified. Let us take a look at which Bollywood celebrities have adopted the NFTs:</p>



<h2><strong>Amitabh Bachhan</strong></h2>



<p>This top spot in this list just had to belong to the Big B, Mr. Amitabh Bachhan! One of the first actors to adopt NFTs &#8211; he has auctioned off certain collectibles, a vintage poster  and also a recording of his voice reciting the poem ‘Madhushala’ written by his late father. One can argue that he is also one of the first people in India to pay a significant amount of GST on the sale of these NFTs. These NFTs were hosted on the NFT marketplace <em>beyondlife.com.</em></p>



<h2><strong>Salman Khan</strong></h2>



<p>Being an actor with one of the largest fan followings in India, it only makes sense for him to launch his own NFT collections. This launch was such a big hit that it is reported that 1 million ‘Bolly tokens’ were sold within 3 hours of launch. The ‘Bolly tokens’ were issued in partnership with <em>Bollycoin</em>. </p>



<h2><strong>Sonu Nigam</strong></h2>



<p>This renowned singer decided to release his first English track, ‘Hall of Fame’, via the NFT market. </p>



<h2><strong>Rajnikanth</strong></h2>



<p>The beloved ‘Thalaiva’ has also decided to take the plunge and launch NFT collectibles based on his hit movie ‘Shivaji the Boss’ released back in 2007. He has partnered with an NFT marketplace named <em>Diginoor.io,</em> which is based in Singapore.</p>



<h2><strong>Kamal Haasan</strong></h2>



<p>The actor had announced his intention to release his own collection of NFTs back in November 2021. On 18th May 2022, the NFTs of his film ‘Vikram’ was launched at Cannes Film Festival. The NFTs were launched in partnership with <em>Fantico</em> and are also said to include a metaverse experience.</p>



<h2><strong>Manish Malhotra</strong></h2>



<p>This popular fashion designer had launched his fashion-themed NFTs on the <em>WazirX NFT</em> marketplace. The NFTs were also said to be sold out in record time after their launch.</p>



<h2><strong>Ritvix X Nucleya</strong></h2>



<p>The popular music artists Ritviz and Nucleya collaborated on an album called ‘Baaraat’ and have used the WazirX NFT marketplace to sell their NFTs based on the theme of their music album.</p>



<p>While the above examples only include Bollywood celebrities, the adoption of NFTs is popular even among cricketers &#8211; Sunil Gavaskar, Yuvraj Singh, Rohit Sharma, and Dinesh Karthik, to name a few. The embracing of the NFTs by these big names has helped boost the authenticity of NFT as a digital product. It may pave the way for not just celebrities but even fans to have some sort of authentic memorabilia of their beloved role models.</p>

<p>The cryptocurrency wave that swept the world in 2021 refuses to go down in 2022 as well. People worldwide have started making huge investments in crypto, and India is no different. In 2021, India became the <a href="https://www-ndtv-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.ndtv.com/business/india-recorded-second-highest-cryptocurrency-users-in-world-in-2021-reveals-new-report-2756538/amp/1?amp_js_v=a6&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQKKAFQArABIIACAw%3D%3D#aoh=16447628918080&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ndtv.com%2Fbusiness%2Findia-recorded-second-highest-cryptocurrency-users-in-world-in-2021-reveals-new-report-2756538" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">second-highest </a>country in crypto adoption globally, next only to Vietnam.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With over <a href="https://www.livemint.com/market/cryptocurrency/india-has-highest-number-of-crypto-owners-in-the-world-at-10-07-crore-report-11634110396397.html" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">ten crore users</a>, cryptocurrency trading has become a rage among Indians, especially Gen Z and millennials. The first step in your crypto trading journey is choosing the right exchange, as you would be transacting all your trades via the exchange only. But a big problem for many crypto owners is the confusion regarding which one&#8217;s the <a href="https://wazirx.com/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">best crypto trading platform in India</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Four Major Considerations for Choosing the Best Crypto Trading Platform in 2022</h2>



<p>Four important factors determine which one&#8217;s the <a href="https://wazirx.com/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">best platform for crypto trading in India</a>.</p>



<h3><strong>#1 Quick KYC&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>An important factor that traders consider while choosing the best cryptocurrency exchange is quick KYC (Know Your Customer). Almost all crypto exchanges require their users to get their KYC verified. While many trading platforms take up a lot of time to complete KYC, some offer quick registration. You will want to go with the second option unless you like standing in long queues.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>#2 Liquidity</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The other major factor worth considering is liquidity. Any good crypto trading platform with higher liquidity should allow traders to complete a transaction quickly since it will be hosting many other traders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>#3 Fees</strong></h3>



<p>Since trading platforms charge a fee on every trade, you must look for platforms that don&#8217;t have a huge fees structure. Unfortunately, some platforms charge fees at every point, be it buying and selling or depositing and withdrawing. This will stop you from making any considerable profits. Hence, you are better off picking up a <a href="https://wazirx.com/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">crypto trading platform</a> that charges a flat amount or percentage on overall trades.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>#4 A Good Mobile App For Trading on the Go</strong></h3>



<p>A good trading platform must have a fully-functional mobile application that offers many important features and perks, such as detailed charts, live-market status, quick buy/sell options, etc. Since many people trade while on the move, it&#8217;s not always possible to trade via the desktop site. Therefore, mobile apps are an important factor while looking for the <a href="https://wazirx.com/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">best crypto trading platform</a> in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>What Makes WazirX the Best Platform for Crypto Trading in India?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Since many people are new to crypto trading and mostly know only about Bitcoin, they need to choose the best Bitcoin trading platform. That&#8217;s why we have gone the extra mile and picked the <a href="https://wazirx.com/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">best crypto trading platform</a> in 2022 for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>WazirX was founded in 2018 and has become the largest and the most trusted <a href="https://wazirx.com/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">cryptocurrency exchange in India</a>.

In addition, WazirX recorded a total trade of over <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/till-now-wazirx-trading-volumes-reach-36-billion-this-year/article37453576.ece" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">$38 billion in 2021</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>India is the second-highest nation in cryptocurrency adoption globally.&nbsp; By 2021, there were more <a href="https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">than 100 million crypto users</a>. The ease of trading crypto attracts more people by the day, while some people are still getting accustomed to the volatility associated with crypto trading. Most of them only invest in a handful of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), etc. People often forget that the more diversified their investment, the better it is. Especially if you&#8217;re new to crypto trading, diversification is your safest bet, and penny cryptocurrencies can surely help you diversify your crypto portfolio beyond the heavily priced cryptos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Penny cryptocurrencies are like penny stocks as they can be bought and sold for less than $1. They have a large potential to earn profit at low risk. This makes them very appealing to crypto users simply testing the waters. You can invest in as many penny cryptocurrencies as you want and build a well-diversified crypto portfolio.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investing in penny cryptocurrencies is also a sound retirement strategy as the accumulated value of penny cryptocurrencies grows by the day. These cryptocurrencies offer a lot more than just being a cheap investment. Before moving on to explore some of the best penny cryptocurrencies to invest in 2022, let&#8217;s learn why they are considered a good investment.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Why are Penny Cryptocurrencies Considered a Good Investment Option?&nbsp;</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-1024x576.jpeg" alt="Why are Penny Cryptocurrencies Considered a Good Investment Option? " class="wp-image-22940" width="378" height="212" srcset="https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-1536x864.jpeg 1536w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-206x116.jpeg 206w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image.jpeg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px" /></figure>



<p>Penny cryptocurrencies have a high risk to reward ratio. They also have a low market cap, so as more people begin to buy penny cryptocurrencies, they will surely rise in value faster than larger <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/7-altcoin-investment-strategies-you-need-to-know/" data-wpel-link="internal">altcoins</a>. </p>



<p>They are a great investment option also because they allow you to diversify your investments. As the saying goes, <em>&#8220;Don’t keep all your eggs in one basket.&#8221;</em> Instead of investing a big amount in only one or two cryptocurrencies, invest small amounts in various penny cryptocurrencies. So if the value of one coin goes down, the others might save your day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now that the advantages are known &#8211; it&#8217;s finally time to decide the best penny <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/top-cryptocurrencies-you-should-buy-and-hold-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">cryptocurrency to invest in 2022</a>. </p>



<p>But before that, it&#8217;s always wise to do your research before making any investment. You can ask around, track the live-market status of these cryptos, and even seek professional help. Since crypto is a new asset class, taking your own time in making a decision is extremely important. That being said, here we go.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The &#8220;metaverse&#8221; appears to be all over the media, in the news, on social media, and on the entirety of the internet these days. Despite the fact that the concept is still in its early phases, it is attracting the interest of IT and <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/5-must-know-tips-as-a-newbie-crypto-investors-5-mistakes-to-avoid/" data-wpel-link="internal">crypto investors</a>. Metaverse coins, as a result, provide an unexplored possibility for 2022.</p>



<p>It also helps that Facebook, one of the world&#8217;s largest internet giants, is banking on the metaverse. The endeavor, which the company refers to as the &#8220;future of technology,&#8221; has already cost them $10 billion. Your imagination is the ceiling in the metaverse, where you will live, play, and connect with others. So naturally, a digital world necessitates an economy, and metaverse currencies, including <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/blockchain-explained/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFTs</a> and other cryptos, are the backbone of the metaverse economy. Let&#8217;s take a look at 5 of the most promising metaverse crypto coins to buy in India in 2022. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that there are several different metaverse worlds, each with its own environments, economies, and currencies. Here we shall discuss the top 5 metaverse crypto coins,  their prices in India, their current performances, and their future prospects. </p>



<h3>1. Axie Infinity (AXS)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-6-1024x390.png" alt="Axie Infinity (AXS)" class="wp-image-22916" width="378" height="143" srcset="https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-6-1024x390.png 1024w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-6-300x114.png 300w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-6-768x292.png 768w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-6-1536x585.png 1536w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-6-228x87.png 228w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-6.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px" /></figure>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/AXS-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Axie Infinity</a> is a game that is comparable to Pokemon in terms of gameplay. Axies (the characters in the game) are <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/blockchain-explained/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFTs</a>, which means they may be sold outside of the game, and players can own, trade, and combat them here. Players may also construct kingdoms, go on treasure hunts, and find resources. It boasts of having the most active and engaged player base among all the metaverse games.</p>



<p>AXS is the game&#8217;s native currency, and players may earn it by participating in a variety of activities. <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/blockchain-explained/" data-wpel-link="internal">AXS</a> is built on the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-ethereum/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum blockchain</a>, and thus it has a hefty gas price, despite the fact that it is accessible for smartphones, Windows, and Mac. However, it is not free to play, and players must have three AXS to participate fully. Its current market capitalization sits at $1.39 Billion and is trading for $22.83 as of 12th May 2022.</p>



<h3>2. Decentraland (MANA)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-5-948x1024.png" alt="Decentraland (MANA" class="wp-image-22915" width="374" height="403" srcset="https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-5-948x1024.png 948w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-5-278x300.png 278w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-5-768x829.png 768w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-5-107x116.png 107w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-5.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px" /></figure>



<p>Decentraland is an Ethereum-based platform that allows you to purchase, trade, or build virtual &#8220;land&#8221; that can be easily explored on your PC, phone, or VR headset. With <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/MANA-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">MANA</a> as its native token,  it is one of the most popular and widely available cryptos on this list, with several <a href="https://wazirx.com/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">crypto exchanges</a> offering it to new consumers.</p>



<p>The value of <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/MANA-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">MANA</a> jumped 400% after Facebook announced its name change to Meta, sparking a great deal of interest in it and the concept of the metaverse as a whole. It now has a market cap of $1.37 billion while trading for $0.7293 as of 12th May 2022.</p>



<h3>3. Sandbox (SAND)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="381" height="280" src="https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-4.png" alt="Sandbox (SAND)" class="wp-image-22914" srcset="https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-4.png 381w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-4-300x220.png 300w, https://wazirx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-4-158x116.png 158w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /></figure>



<p>The Ethereum-based crypto metaverse project ‘The Sandbox’ has performed admirably so far. <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/SAND-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">SAND</a>, the platform&#8217;s native token, has been steadily rising throughout 2021, ultimately crossing the $1 barrier in the fourth quarter, maintaining its upward trend.</p>



<p>With a VR aspect, this project is a game, but it&#8217;s mainly reliant on the generation and trading of <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/blockchain-explained/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFTs</a> that are made possible by the <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/SAND-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">SAND token</a>. Another appealing feature is the finite currency supply of 3 billion tokens, of which over 680 million are already in circulation. Its market cap stands at $1.44 Billion, with the value of one SAND token being $1.17 as of 12th May 2022. </p>



<h3>4. Highstreet (HIGH)</h3>



<p>Highstreet is a fascinating metaverse project that shows a lot of promise for metaverse users. For starters, you may use the currency HIGH to shop for items within this virtual realm. In addition, the gaming platform has already incorporated certain Shopify merchants.</p>



<p>From the perspective of the actual world (the metaverse), this initiative has already achieved what the metaverse technology set out to deliver. So this is a good alternative if you&#8217;re an investor who looks at functionality as a requirement.</p>



<p>HTC is backing the initiative, which received $5 million in funding in August 2021. It also has gaming and NFTs on its radar, indicating that it is up to speed on tech and crypto developments. Its current market cap is $20.01 Million and is trading for $1.63 as of 12th May 2022.</p>



<h3>5. Floki Inu</h3>



<p>Another dog-themed &#8220;meme token,&#8221; Floki Inu, seems to be a serious contender for a competitive and sustainable metaverse cryptocurrency — especially for those seeking for cheap coins.</p>



<p>According to the project&#8217;s website, the goal is to merge memes with real-world applications, and it also claims to be launching a game as well as an NFT marketplace. People have been buying FLOKI tokens despite the fact that the project is still in its early stages.</p>



<p>Floki Inu currently has no (certified) market capitalization, and, as unusual as it sounds, the value of the coin has increased by a whopping 1331% since its introduction in July 2021.</p>



<p>Metaverse initiatives are springing up all over the place, but some have considerable potential and outshine others. The metaverse concept is heavily founded in <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/blockchain-explained/" data-wpel-link="internal">blockchain</a> and crypto, which is why investing in some of these ventures may be a good option, given that the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/a-guide-to-nfts/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFT</a> buzz appears to be growing.</p>



<p>However, like any other investment, don&#8217;t put all your eggs in one basket when it comes to metaverse coins. It&#8217;s advisable to diversify your holdings and, more crucially, purchase currencies that you believe have a promising future.</p>

<p>Cloud mining is a technique that is used for mining cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Both miners and third-party suppliers profit from the strategy. In addition, Crypto cloud mining, unlike classic mining programs, is a cost-effective method.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll give you an overview of crypto cloud mining in this blog.</p>



<h2>Cloud mining: An introduction</h2>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/is-cryptocurrency-mining-harming-our-planet/" data-wpel-link="internal">Cloud mining</a> is a type of mining a cryptocurrency such as bitcoin utilizing rented cloud computing power rather than installing and running the gear and software directly. Cloud mining companies allow anyone to register an account and engage in bitcoin mining remotely for a small fee, making mining more accessible to people worldwide. In addition, because this type of mining is done on the cloud, it eliminates difficulties like equipment maintenance and direct energy expenditures.</p>



<p>Cloud miners join a mining pool, allowing users to buy a specific amount of &#8220;hash power.&#8221; Then, each participant receives a pro-rata share of the revenues based on how much hashing power they rented.</p>



<h2>Understanding cloud mining in-depth</h2>



<p>Cloud mining is the deployment of cloud computing to create blockchain-based coins. Cloud computing is a rapidly increasing technological trend in which computer services such as processing, hosting services, database services, applications, and file storage are available via the cloud over the Internet. Such businesses bill based on consumption, similar to how we pay for water or electricity.</p>



<p>Mining, on the other hand, is the bedrock of cryptocurrency schemes such as bitcoin. It is the process of validating and adding transactions to a public ledger called the blockchain. It is also the procedure used to distribute new currencies. Individuals in rural areas with little or no technical competence or physical infrastructure can engage in mining thanks to the combination of the two.</p>



<h2>Key features of cloud mining</h2>



<ul><li>Cloud mining may be deployed to mine cryptocurrencies by employing mining equipment from third-party cloud providers.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Cloud mining lowers the total cost of mining and allows even novices with no experience to mine cryptocurrency.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Hash power is necessary to start a mining operation.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The sole downside of cloud computing is that its final earnings are subject to demand fluctuations.</li></ul>



<h2>How does cloud mining work?</h2>



<p>Whether done in the cloud or locally, mining for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin does not require any real mining. While this procedure does result in new cryptocurrency tokens being issued to miners, the mining operation is far more critical for ensuring the security of a distributed ledger like a<a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/blockchain-a-boon-to-strengthen-indian-dynamism/" data-wpel-link="internal"> blockchain</a>. Bitcoin mining is carried out by high-powered computers that tackle challenging computational arithmetic problems that are quite difficult to finish by hand and complex enough to drain even the most powerful computers.</p>



<p>Part of the function of bitcoin miners is to verify that the transactions in a new block of transactions on the blockchain are correct. Bitcoin miners, in particular, ensure that bitcoin is not copied, a peculiar feature of digital currencies known as &#8220;double spend.&#8221; Of course, counterfeiting is always a concern with printed money. However, after spending $20 at a store, the cashier usually has your bill. But it&#8217;s a different scenario with digital currency. In a decentralized fashion, miners employ their processing capacity to solve cryptographic challenges that prevent double-spending.</p>



<h2>Types of cloud mining models</h2>



<p>There are majorly two types of Cloud Mining Models; they are described below:</p>



<p><strong>Host Mining:</strong></p>



<p>This is the most used cloud mining model. Miners must purchase or lease mining rigs to mine. The miner is then responsible for the setup and upkeep. The overhead expenses associated with access to energy are reduced by host mining. This technique also allows miners more control over the rig, directing the hashing power generated to mining pools.</p>



<p>You have total control over your earned benefits when you use this model. The economies of scale of a mining farm lower the high mining costs, such as electricity and storage. However, the initial cost may be considerable, but it will decrease with time, and you may expect to earn handsomely.</p>



<p><strong>Leasing Hash Power:</strong></p>



<p>A high hash rate is required for mining success. You are not charged for maintenance or setup under this cloud mining approach. However, you must sign up for an appropriate plan supplied by the mining business to get your portion of the profit earned by the mining far.</p>



<p>Profits from freshly found blocks are divided among all users according to their shares of hash power. In comparison to bitcoin, altcoins are mined with cloud mining.</p>



<h2>Advantages and disadvantages of cloud mining</h2>



<p>Advantages:</p>



<ul><li>You have the option of mining whichever cryptocurrency you choose.</li><li>All of the regular mining difficulties are handled by the business.</li><li>The costs of running mining equipment are reduced by using cloud mining.</li><li>Using &#8220;someone else&#8217;s&#8221; equipment generally provides more earnings than using your own.</li><li>Fast scaling (capacity expansion) is impossible without equipment failure and resulting revenue loss.</li></ul>



<p>Disadvantages:</p>



<ul><li>Mining revenues are lowered because of the commissions connected with hiring a storage facility.</li><li>You should keep an eye on the market and react to what&#8217;s going on in the crypto industry.</li><li>As the network grows more complex, the cost of renting more capacity rises.</li></ul>



<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>



<p>Cloud mining is a viable alternative to traditional hardware crypto mining. Miners do not need to invest in costly mining equipment or worry about its upkeep and improvements. Furthermore, the cloud crypto mining procedure is relatively straightforward, and anyone with no prior understanding of the crypto environment might try it.</p>



<p>Cloud crypto mining, if done correctly, can pave the way for large-scale crypto adoption in the future.</p>

<p>Ether (ETH) is one of the second-largest cryptocurrencies, according to the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Coin Market Cap</a>. And you&#8217;re not alone if you use the phrases Ethereum and ETH interchangeably in conversation.</p>



<p>However, there is a distinction to be made between the cryptocurrency ETH and the Ethereum network. Like most cryptos, Ethereum is a hybrid of a digital asset and a blockchain. The Ethereum network is a smart contract-focused blockchain.</p>



<p>Smart contracts are used to develop programs for a number of reasons, including the usage of decentralized apps (DApps). This is because of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), they are able to do so.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s take a closer look at this topic and understand it in depth.</p>



<p>Before we move forward and learn about Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), it is very important to understand the concept of smart contracts.</p>



<h2>What are smart contracts?</h2>



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-are-smart-contracts-and-why-you-need-to-know-about-them/" data-wpel-link="internal">Smart contracts</a> are algorithms that operate on the Ethereum blockchain. A contract is a collection of data and code stored at an Ethereum address. It&#8217;s a cryptocurrency account that exists. They may send transactions over the network just like any other account, but instead of being managed by a user, they are released to the network and function according to their programming.</p>



<p>Registered users can then communicate with the smart contract. This requires sending transactions that perform the functions defined in the contract. Smart contracts have many characteristics: they utilize code to enforce pre-determined rules, they cannot be deleted, and transactions using them cannot be reversed.</p>



<p>Here comes the EVM notion. You should be familiar with the phrase Ethereum Virtual Machine if you&#8217;re seeking to create a smart contract on the Ethereum network (EVM). In general, virtual machines establish a layer of abstraction between both the running code and the running machine. This layer is necessary to improve software portability and guarantee that applications are separated from one another and their host.</p>



<h2>Ethereum Virtual Machine &#8211; Definition</h2>



<p></p>



<p>The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a sophisticated, specialized software virtual stack that executes contract bytecode and is built into every Ethereum node. Simply said, EVM is a software architecture that enables developers to create decentralized Ethereum applications (DApps). This virtual computer houses all Ethereum accounts and smart contracts.</p>



<p>Contracts are often written in high-level programming languages like Solidity and then compiled into EVM bytecode. This means the machine code is isolated from the host computer&#8217;s network, disk, and other functions. Every node in the Ethereum network runs an EVM instance, which allows them to agree on the same set of instructions to be carried out.</p>



<p>The EVM is Turing complete, which implies it can finish every logical step in a computation. Let&#8217;s first have a better understanding of Turing completeness.</p>



<h2>A quick introduction to Turing completeness</h2>



<p></p>



<p>The phrase &#8220;Turning machines&#8221; was coined by Alan Turing, a well-known computer scientist.</p>



<p>Turing machines, also known as automatic machines, are hypothetical machines that exemplify Turing&#8217;s concept of non-human or machine thinking. The cognitive process is guided by algorithms.</p>



<p>Such a computer, according to Turing&#8217;s paper, would have to process a reel of tape containing a line of symbols or functions that could be switched back and forth. To transition between these functions, a read/write head might be utilized. As a result, the machine would be able to digest and alter symbols. This machine could only concentrate on one &#8220;state&#8221; at a time.</p>



<p>Because they constitute the cornerstone of Ethereum Virtual Machine&#8217;s idea and design, understanding them is vital.</p>



<h2>Purpose of an Ethereum Virtual Machine</h2>



<p></p>



<p>The EVM&#8217;s purpose is to determine the overall status of Ethereum for each block on the blockchain.</p>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/2022-ethereum-outlook/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum</a>, like all other blockchain-based networks, has its own native currency (ETH) and uses a distributed ledger to log transactions while enforcing certain restrictions on how users interact with the network. The smart contract features of Ethereum, on the other hand, add a further layer of capability.</p>



<p>The second layer is known as a &#8220;distributed state machine.&#8221; At its most basic level, Ethereum&#8217;s state is a massive database including all ETH accounts and balances.</p>



<p>Ethereum&#8217;s state is also a machine state, capable of changing each new block and running any form of machine code according to a set of rules. The Ethereum Virtual Machine specifies the rules that govern how the machine changes state with each new block.</p>



<h2>Advantages of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</h2>



<p></p>



<ul><li>Anyone can create their own DApp using the EVM. There are various applications for this sort of software, and it isn&#8217;t limited to a specific demographic or individuals with a lot of money or connections.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Smart contracts have several potential advantages. Non-fungible tokens are a recent example (NFTs). Using NFTs, anybody can create digital art and trade it on a decentralized marketplace. This democratizes previously inaccessible virtual access to the art market.</li></ul>



<h2>Disadvantages of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</h2>



<p></p>



<ul><li>The EVM system isn&#8217;t completely decentralized. The vast majority of Ethereum nodes run on centralized cloud servers such as Amazon Web Services. If the holders of these services determine they don&#8217;t like Ethereum for whatever reason, the nodes might be switched off, leading the network to be harmed or destroyed. This has happened before, for example, with some social networking apps.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The EVM necessitates some technical expertise. The EVM is only available to individuals who are unable to code. The creation of more user-friendly interfaces is still in progress. Again, there are tools with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that allow nearly anybody to develop NFTs and utilize related markets.</li></ul>



<h2>Final words</h2>



<p></p>



<p>Since Ethereum is a transaction-based &#8220;state&#8221; machine, it may be used to implement any transaction-based state machine notion. Developers may utilize practically any Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) specification to generate smart contracts for a variety of reasons.</p>

<p>Championing the mission of user protection and creating transparency, we have launched the second edition of our Transparency report. The developments covered in the report occurred between October 2021 and March 2022. It illustrates the company&#8217;s initiatives and partnerships in the last six months to safeguard investors. We have also outlined the various scams you need to be aware of, as these are still done through phones and emails and not on the blockchain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is a moment of pride to state that we had a 100% compliance rate for all the 1023 requests received from Law Enforcement Agencies (LEA) during this period. Compared to the six months before, we were able to comply with more LEA requests due to cutting-edge tech-enabled monitoring capabilities through an optimum mix of Round-The-Clock Voice Support and Chat Support. We also increased the hiring of talent with domain expertise.</p>



<p><strong>Here are some of the major findings:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Recorded an improvement in average turnaround time at&nbsp; 22 minutes, although the recommended duration is 48 to 72 hours, as per&nbsp; IT Act, 2000.</li><li>952 queries were by Indian Law Enforcement Agencies, whereas the Foreign LEAs made&nbsp; 71 requests. 100% of these were criminal in nature.</li><li>17,218 accounts were locked, indicating a 19% increase from April – September 2021. 73% of these locked accounts were due to requests initiated directly by the customers, and WazirX’s legal team locked 27% due to ongoing investigations by LEA or payment disputes.</li><li>The majority of the scams reported were traditional money market scams.</li></ul>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“The insights of the report indicate that even now, the vast majority of&nbsp; scams are due to misinformation. They occur due to lack of awareness amongst users and indicate a requirement of large scale education and awareness programs to safeguard user interests. We are committed to strengthening the Virtual Digital Assets landscape in India through effective scrutiny and review, collaborations with compliance platforms and educational institutes to spread awareness to avert frauds.”</p><cite><strong>Nischal Shetty, CEO and Founder, WazirX</strong></cite></blockquote>



<p>The statement signifies that we need more and more people to identify these kinds of frauds. As per the report, the majority of scams are these:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Impersonation Scams:</strong> In these scams, the imposter poses as a famous and credible individual from the VDA industry and demands money from victims.</li></ol>



<p>In a recent case, an imposter tried to dupe investors by creating a telegram channel with fake profiles of crypto-exchange founders. As a result, a request was registered with the concerned platform to take down the channel and the corresponding fake profiles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our legal team has proactively coordinated and supported LEAs on several requests regarding impersonation fraud.</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Social Engineering Scams</strong>: Here, under pretexts ranging from credit card expiry to bank account validation, the scammers aim to instill a sense of urgency and fear in the victim. They then push them into taking quick action without careful assessment. WazirX noted that it had witnessed a growth in such LEA requests about social engineering scams.</li></ol>



<p>We recently got a request where on the pretext of blocking a credit card, a certain amount of VDA’s was demanded by the scammer. The scam, however, was later detected, and the amount was retrieved.</p>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Identity Theft</strong>: In the case of ID theft, a scammer wrongfully obtains and uses another person&#8217;s personal data for fraud or deception, typically for economic gains.</li></ol>



<p>In one such case of identity theft detected by our team, the identified victim was aged 85 and had no ITR history. He claimed agriculture as his source of livelihood. Upon further scrutiny, his distant relative was found operating the WazirX account illegally, transacting large amounts. The victim was misguided by his relative to complete KYC checks successfully. Eventually, the user’s account was blocked till further notice.</p>

<p>Tether is now hitting new lows every day. During the recent crypto meltdown, investors have pulled out $7 billion from the world&#8217;s largest stablecoin.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">CoinMarketCap</a>, the market circulation of Tether, commonly known as USDT, fell from over $83 billion on May 11 to roughly $76 billion on Tuesday, May 17. In addition, another prominent stablecoin, UST, and its sister crypto, <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/luna-crashes-over-99-whats-happening-with-this-cryptocurrency/" data-wpel-link="internal">LUNA</a>, both crashed simultaneously.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a snapshot of how Tether&#8217;s price has been declining over the last month:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xG4FTFocTnxoINsndtLFHH1ZVQb6a1y5UrUuQ2q26XrzIbZgyUOvJHRCJ2uLIvUdYlnrt1epGXIRYu9T4nrIDbF4sq2cwh0OW8OUN2te9LlxjkWhDn6JXTsTy2o8FuUXvixC0f6Re82SpE2CRg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>Before we dive deeper, let&#8217;s have a quick overview of Tether.</p>



<h2>What is Tether?</h2>



<p>USDT is a stablecoin (stable-value cryptocurrency) created by Tether, a Hong Kong-based firm. This coin generally matches the US dollar price.</p>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-tether-usdt/" data-wpel-link="internal">Tether</a> was formerly known as RealCoin and was renamed Tether in November 2014. In February of 2015, it began trading. Tether, which was founded on the Bitcoin blockchain, currently supports the Omni and Liquid protocols of Bitcoin and the Ethereum, TRON, EOS, Algorand, Solana, OMG Network, and Bitcoin Cash blockchains.</p>



<p>With a market valuation of almost $76 billion as of May 2022, Tether is the third-biggest cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) and also, and it is the largest stablecoin. Tether&#8217;s USDT accounted for two-thirds of Bitcoin trades by value in April 2022.</p>



<h2>How does Tether work?</h2>



<p>Tether issues the appropriate digital amount in tokens when a customer puts fiat money into Tether&#8217;s reserve and sells fiat to purchase USDT. After then, the USDT can be traded, saved, or swapped.</p>



<p>If a user puts $100 in the Tether reserve, they will get 100 Tether tokens based on a one-to-one dollar parity. However, when users redeem Tether tokens for fiat cash, the coins are destroyed and taken out of circulation.</p>



<p>Tether, like many other digital currencies, flows across blockchains. As a result, Tether tokens are accessible on various blockchains, including the original Omni on the Bitcoin platform. Liquid, Ethereum (ETH), and TRON (TRX) are among others.</p>



<p>Following the collapse of Terra USD last week, which exposed vulnerabilities in the processes designed to mitigate stablecoin volatility, investors have become skeptical of other cryptocurrencies similar to Tether.</p>



<p>So, why are investors abandoning Tether?</p>



<p>Whatever is going on with Tether has a backstory that entails a controversy. So let&#8217;s take a closer look at what happened.</p>



<h2>Tether&#8217;s Backstory</h2>



<p>Tether&#8217;s mechanisms have been a source of debate in recent years since they have been ambiguous for a long time.</p>



<p>Its coins are supposed to be backed by fiat currency collateral reserves, making it one of the most reliable stablecoins, alongside the USD Coin, backed in a one-to-one ratio by dollars held in a bank.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Tether always claimed that it was backed entirely by a 1:1 ratio of dollar notes.</p></blockquote>



<p>However, a series of lawsuits beginning in 2019—including a New York Attorney General&#8217;s investigation into financial mismanagement—has proven that to be untrue:</p>



<ul><li>Tether&#8217;s lawyer indicated in April 2019 that 74 cents backed each currency in cash or cash equivalents.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Then, in May 2021, Tether released a <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/104780/tether-usdt-reserves-breakdown-first-time-since-launch" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">report</a> revealing that just 2.9% of Tether was backed by cash, with the rest held in a variety of assets, including 49.6% commercial paper—short-term, unsecured debt issued by corporations that provide investors little protection in the event of default.</li></ul>



<p>According to critics, Tether&#8217;s self-published reports appear to lack auditing, especially now that the mix of its holdings has allegedly evolved to include more significant assets.</p>



<ul><li>It released a second <a href="https://tether.to/en/transparency/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">report</a> in August 2021, revealing that the cash backing had increased to 10.2%. A significant portion of the pie chart was now in Treasury bills—a short-term debt obligation serviced by the federal government, which had increased from 2.2% to 24.7%.</li></ul>



<p>In a Twitter Spaces chat, Tether&#8217;s chief technology officer, Paolo Ardoino, emphasized that a large percentage of its reserves are now in Treasury bills.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tether has slashed its exposure to the commercial paper following the previous week&#8217;s crisis, which saw the price of Tether briefly fall to 95 cents on Thursday, sparking fears of another bank failure.</p>



<h2>So, what now?</h2>



<p>The issue now is whether Tether would be able to pay out all of its investors if they all left simultaneously. Ardoino <a href="https://twitter.com/paoloardoino/status/1526512388425515009" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> that the $7 billion was redeemed &#8220;in the blink of an eye&#8230; we can keep going if the market wishes, we have all the liquidity to manage massive redemptions and pay everyone 1-to-1&#8221; on Twitter today.</p>



<p>Investors that lost $50 billion as a result of Terra USD&#8217;s downfall, on the other hand, would undoubtedly advise you not to rely or stake money on words alone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, before you make your next move, DYOR!</p>

<p>Blockchain is a decentralized ecosystem driven by distributed ledger technology. However, when we delve further, it becomes clear that this is not an accumulating ecosystem. There are several blockchains on the market, and each Blockchain ecosystem is separate from the others.</p>



<p>Furthermore, individual chains were created with distinct use-cases in mind; therefore, they have unique strengths, weaknesses, and degrees of decentralization. For example, if the goal of a blockchain is to increase transaction throughput, the Blockchain&#8217;s decentralization and security may suffer.</p>



<p>Blockchains are unable to communicate with one another since they reside in silos. It indicates that one chain&#8217;s strength cannot assist other chains and that a blockchain&#8217;s limitations cannot be mitigated by using the characteristics of another chain. These divisions dilute Blockchain&#8217;s potential and worth as an industry, reducing user experience and impeding industry growth.</p>



<p>This is where the Cross-chain technology comes into play. It&#8217;s a way to improve blockchain communication with one another. Interoperability is facilitated by a cross-chain architecture, allowing two or more blockchains to trade off their efficiency, decentralization, feature set, and security. This can help to increase chain efficiency, eliminate fragmentation, and allow users and features to move freely across many blockchains.</p>



<h2>Introduction to cross-chain technology</h2>



<p>The widespread adoption of blockchain platforms has brought to light difficulties with processing speed and scalability in earlier blockchains. Furthermore, because all blockchains function separately and do not connect, developers face a unique challenge: users will be unable to benefit from blockchain technology fully.</p>



<p>People on various blockchains cannot achieve optimal decentralization unless connected through a standard protocol. Cross-chain technology tries to overcome this problem by allowing multiple blockchains to communicate. It implies they&#8217;ll all be able to converse and exchange information. To learn more about blockchain interoperability, <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/all-about-blockchain-interoperability/" data-wpel-link="internal">click here</a>.</p>



<p>The cross-chain protocols aim to improve connection and are interoperable with various blockchains. This means that financial transactions across two entirely separate blockchains are possible. Previously, crypto-enabled businesses could only take payments from clients who used the identical Blockchain, preventing them from freely transacting with other blockchain-based firms.</p>



<p>Through such an environment, transaction fees will be significantly reduced, and downtime will be eliminated.</p>



<h2>Characteristics of cross-chain technology</h2>



<ul><li>The atomicity concept supports cross-chain technologies.</li><li>It ensures that numerous interconnected blockchains are consistent.</li><li>It allows networks to be distributed over several platforms.</li></ul>



<h2>Importance of cross-chain technology in Blockchain interoperability</h2>



<p>The significance of cross-chain technology is that it allows users to communicate data and trade tokens without an intermediary. Furthermore, this architecture enables blockchain interoperability, allowing two or more blockchains to improve efficiency while balancing decentralization and security.</p>



<p>It is also necessary because it increases chain efficiency, decreases segmentation, and allows users to communicate across numerous blockchains freely. As a result, cross-chain technology has a lot of promise for allowing blockchain interoperability, which can address many problems and eliminate a lot of limits on Blockchain and other networks.</p>



<h2>How does cross-chain technology work?</h2>



<p>There is no one method for implementing cross-chain technology. To support transactions across numerous chains without using third parties or centralized solutions, different networks may adopt other methods for blockchain interoperability.</p>



<p>Some techniques for cross-chain communication are listed below.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Atomic Swaps</strong></li></ol>



<p>Since two chains do not interact, atomic swaps are not a real kind of cross-chain communication. However, the system allows users to coordinate transactions across chains, allowing for direct peer-to-peer trade of one cryptocurrency for another.</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Stateless SPVs</strong></li></ol>



<p>It allows a smart contract with enough sophistication to validate a portion of Proof of Work history. As stateless SPVs are generally affordable, they may be customized to a broad range of use cases.</p>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Relays</strong></li></ol>



<p>Relays allow a smart contract on one chain to validate events on other chains. On-demand, Relay may check a chain&#8217;s complete history and particular headers. The relay approach makes trade-offs between the Relay&#8217;s security and its operational cost. Relays, on the other hand, are sometimes fairly costly to operate.</p>



<ol start="4"><li><strong>Merged Consensus</strong></li></ol>



<p>A relay chain is used to facilitate two-way interoperability between chains. To guarantee a merged consensus, the chain must be designed from the ground up. Projects like ETH 2.0 and Cosmos use joined consensus.</p>



<ol start="5"><li><strong>Federations</strong></li></ol>



<p>A restricted set of trustworthy persons can use federations to certify the happenings of one chain on another. Federations are strong, but they require a third party&#8217;s faith. That is its primary flaw since it undermines the decentralization of Blockchain.</p>



<h2>Future of cross-chain technology</h2>



<p>The development of cross-chain technology is still in its early stages. As a result, some questions about cross-chain technologies remain unsolved.</p>



<p>Cross-chain technology has the potential to expand token use cases and accelerate blockchain adoption in the future. Aside from token exchanges, the system must also allow information, payment, and resource sharing. Furthermore, token transactions should be more straightforward, and consumers should only rely on one wallet system. Finally, customers should be able to do business successfully in real-time on numerous blockchains without incurring hefty fees in a commercial scenario.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, cross-chain technology development has advantages such as improved user experience and efficiency. Furthermore, the sector will be less competitive, which is advantageous since the value of blockchain advantages will be preserved. Projects are frequently formed as responses to the competition in the crypto sector. Distinct <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/blockchain-a-boon-to-strengthen-indian-dynamism/" data-wpel-link="internal">blockchain projects </a>have different transaction methods and features. As a result of the lower competitiveness, cross-chain transactions within the sector may become less complicated.</p>



<h2>Final takeaway</h2>



<p>The interoperability of blockchains and crossover technologies are two critical components of blockchain technology in general. By combining the two concepts, we can not only learn more about cryptocurrency and its world but also promote blockchain adoption. The key reason for the emphasis on cross-chain technology is that it has significant potential to address present difficulties. From scalability concerns to the critical requirement for transparency on blockchain networks, cross-chain technology can provide several answers to the blockchain ecosystem&#8217;s core problems. As a result, it is reasonable to conclude that cross-chain technology represents a nascent future revolution!</p>

<p>LUNA, a cryptocurrency linked to the TerraUSD stablecoin, is now essentially worthless. LUNA was worth $0.01862 as of noon Thursday, May 12, 2022, and as of May 16, 2022, it is floating at $0.0002436 according to coinmarketcap.com.</p>



<p>In a matter of time, this algorithm-backed altcoin <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/depegged-terrausd-butchered-luna-terra-plunged-97-in-a-month/articleshow/91492360.cms" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">dropped by 97%</a>, sending shivers across the spines of all investors. Here is a snapshot view of what the steep decline looked like:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WOhKW8rHtxKj10qFIYW4t4O6MWfts9OiLmx1kEVwhcaEu_UJ0TBZeynbftt7bg4FKET0voVXWyT-Fc5L961OOW2iTpS_ZBp9cDfq1c7t-RY_sbZPM7sXSeqOoT2crCAQg5sLDUmSvQwiu5O8Lg" alt="" /></figure>

<h2>What is Terra?</h2>



<p>Terra is an open-source blockchain technology for an algorithmic stablecoin*, a type of cryptocurrency that tracks the price of currencies or other assets. Terra stablecoins could be instantaneously spent, saved, traded, or exchanged thanks to the Terra blockchain.</p>



<p>The Terra protocol generates stablecoins that monitor the price of a fiat currency over time (a government-backed currency such as the U.S. dollar or euro). Terra (LUNA) and TerraUSD (UST) are the two crypto coins that make up Terra.</p>



<p><strong>*Stablecoins</strong> are digital currencies tied to conventional assets like the U.S. dollar. They are a widespread means of exchange, typically utilized by traders to shift cash around and speculate on other cryptocurrencies during the market upheaval.</p>



<h2>LUNA &amp; UST &#8211; The what, how, and why</h2>



<p>Luna (LUNA) and TerraUSD (UST) are two native tokens of the Terra network, a blockchain-based project developed by Terra Labs in South Korea. As the laters name suggests, the United States Dollar is linked to TerraUSD. As per the founders&#8217; plans, people were meant to be able to exchange one for the other (LUNA for UST and vice versa) if one of the two dropped below that price.</p>



<p>From the use cases angle, other than payments, lending, borrowing, and donating, LUNA lets users pay network fees, vote in elections, invest in the Tendermint Delegated Proof of Stake consensus method, and peg stablecoins. Furthermore, the Terra ecosystem&#8217;s consensus process allowed LUNA holders to stake their tokens. Users who staked LUNA received payouts derived directly from Terra protocol switch fees*.</p>



<p>*<strong>Switch fees</strong> are charged when users transition between LUNA and a Terra stablecoin.</p>



<p>Before this drop, LUNA was the tenth-largest cryptocurrency, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terra-luna/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Coinmarketcap</a>, with a total market cap of nearly $34 billion, overtaking Polkadot and Avalanche. LUNA had increased by 12,000%. However, the 2022 beginning was not great for LUNA. It started this year at less than $1.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>What went wrong with LUNA?</h2>



<p>While there are multiple theories as to what went wrong, here are a few that could probably make sense:</p>



<ul><li>On May 7, 2022, over $2 billion worth of UST was unstaked, and hundreds of millions of that were immediately sold. This could have triggered the volatility and the market sentiments, eventually affecting the cryptocurrency’s prices. As expected, people rushed to take advantage of the arbitrage by exchanging 90 cents worth of UST for $1 worth of LUNA. However, the speed breaker changed the game as only $100 million worth of UST could be burned for LUNA in a day. Whether this was a planned move or just the heat of the moment could be debated in detail. However, some have <a href="https://www.cnet.com/google-amp/news/luna-crypto-crash-how-ust-broke-why-it-matters-and-whats-next/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">speculated</a> that an attacker attempted to break UST in order to profit from shorting bitcoin &#8212; that is, betting on its price going down.</li><li>Charles Hoskinson, the inventor of Cardano, proposed one possibility, although he later removed the tweet. He indicated that a huge organization had borrowed 100,000 Bitcoin from the Gemini exchange on Twitter. They subsequently exchanged a significant sum of BTC for UST at a discount with Do Kwon over the counter (OTC). Thus the UST liquidity was reduced. That institution allegedly dumped massive sums of BTC and UST on the market, resulting in a liquidation avalanche of leveraged longs, slippage, and panic selling by investors, with many liquidating their LUNA holdings unstaking their UST to sell it. According to that tweet, Terra was a massive scam with insufficient BTC reserves to avert the crash. However, none of these allegations have been proven, and Gemini has stated that it did not provide such a loan.</li></ul>



<p>In contrast, market manipulation is ubiquitous in all financial systems. Even if Gemini&#8217;s post is correct, Hoskinson (@IOHK Charles) subsequently <a href="https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1524448908990197760" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> that someone did assault, Terra. For the time being, no one knows who it was, and social media is awash with speculation and many interpretations.</p>



<ul><li>As vouched by many experts, Algorithm failure seems to be one of the base reasons.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2>Will LUNA recover and get back stronger?</h2>



<p>Catching a falling knife and buying Terra (LUNA) at this juncture is a high-risk investment when it has dropped 98–99% twice in two days. The difficulty that several investors who bought the dip failed to anticipate is that hyperinflation would drastically increase the circulating supply of LUNA. As a result, if LUNA were to reach its previous all-time high at this moment, it would overtake Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization. The primary issue is the inflation of the LUNA supply in circulation, which Terra Labs and the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) would burn to recoup.</p>



<p>Proposals 1164 and 1188 to burn $UST has been<a href="https://twitter.com/terra_money/status/1524665456476712961" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer"> announced</a> on the official TerraUSD (UST) Twitter account to correct the problem. In addition, the Terra blockchain was shut down on May 13, 2022, &#8216;to avoid governance assaults as a result of extreme $LUNA inflation.&#8217;</p>



<p>Some experts on <a href="https://twitter.com/jonwu_/status/1523793482850050048" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">crypto Twitter </a>say that the risk/reward of buying LUNA is reasonable, given that the LUNA slide from its all-time high of $119.55 to the current 2022 low of 0.00004 USDT was a 99.999% correction.</p>



<p>LUNA still has a significant following and community of investors that are optimistic about the Terra project and a more prominent leadership team than Do Kwon, who has lost popularity in the crypto community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, most of the crypto exchanges in India have already <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/indian-crypto-exchanges-delist-terra-luna-after-100-crash-in-token-bitcoin-below-30k/videoshow/91559256.cms?from=mdr" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">delisted</a> LUNA.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>



<p>The question still arises: Will LUNA rebound in 2022 or 2023? Unfortunately, with exchanges delisting LUNA and its bailout not materializing and BTC losing monthly support, a LUNA price projection is impossible at this moment.</p>



<p>Rather than predicting the future, let&#8217;s wait and see what happens next?</p>



<h2>But for now, How is WazirX handling the LUNA downfall and its disheartened investors?</h2>



<p>WazirX <a href="https://support.wazirx.com/hc/en-us/articles/4597814576282" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">delisted</a> 3 market pairs associated withLUNA (LUNA/USDT, LUNA/INR, and LUNA/WRX) on May 13, 2022. While these downfalls are not in the hands of the exchanges, we at WazirX have tried our best to enable the LUNA investors to withdraw their funds. For this, Binance free transfers have been enabled for users to withdraw their LUNA funds.</p>

The fundamental advantage of blockchain services is that they guarantee transaction transparency for both the grantee and the recipient. In recent years, organizations have been managing data for blockchain-based solutions as on-chain or off-chain storage techniques. This can be accomplished by storing information in a private or public blockchain service.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at what an off-chain transaction entails.</p>



<h2>What are off-chain transactions?</h2>



<p>Off-chain transactions are transactions that take place outside of the blockchain and can be carried out in various ways. To begin with, a transfer agreement might be reached between two parties. Second, a third party may ensure that the transaction is complete and accurate. Finally, in the transaction, the third party acts as a form of a guarantor.</p>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/difference-between-on-chain-off-chain-transactions/" data-wpel-link="internal">Off-chain transactions</a> are instantaneous; however, on-chain transactions might take a long time to complete depending on the number of transactions awaiting confirmation on the same network.</p>



<h2>Why choose off-chain transactions?</h2>



<p>There are several reasons why an off-chain storage mechanism should be considered when designing a blockchain system. Here are a few examples:</p>



<p>• It is quicker. The transactions are promptly recorded without the need to wait for network confirmations.</p>



<p>• It&#8217;s less expensive. Off-chain transactions are frequently accessible.</p>



<p>• It offers additional privacy. These transactions are hidden from the public blockchain.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at the most popular off-chain protocols nowadays.</p>



<h2>Off-chain protocols</h2>



<p>While there is only one Bitcoin blockchain, several off-chain protocols provide various advantages over on-chain transactions. A couple of these will be covered further down.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Lightning network</strong></li></ol>



<p>The Lightning Network (LN) is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network that allows users to send bitcoin off-chain instantly and with almost no costs. The Lightning Network is a layer two solution constructed on top of the Bitcoin network.</p>



<p>Using an on-chain transaction known as a funding transaction, the Lightning Network allows two parties to lock bitcoin in a multi-sig address. Then, the parties can use an arbitrary amount of off-chain transactions to change the balances within that address. These transactions are both quick and costless. Finally, when both parties have finished their transactions, they can balance their accounts via an on-chain transaction.</p>



<p>The Lightning Network compresses an infinite number of transactions into two on-chain transactions, substantially decreasing transaction costs and wait times.</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Liquid network</strong></li></ol>



<p>The Liquid Network is a Bitcoin-based <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-are-sidechains/" data-wpel-link="internal">sidechain system</a>. The Blockstream firm established the Liquid Network, which runs on its blockchain. Since block reorganizations of more than two blocks are prohibited, and new blocks are generated every minute, Liquid allows for speedier settlement than Bitcoin&#8217;s network. Liquid also supports anonymous transactions, which hide the amount being transmitted, presently unavailable on the Bitcoin network.</p>



<p>Users can transfer bitcoin (BTC) to a multi-signature address on the Bitcoin network using Liquid. A peg-in transaction is what it&#8217;s called. The Liquid Network will release an identical quantity of Liquid bitcoin (L-BTC) to the user on the Liquid blockchain after pegging in bitcoin.</p>



<p>L-BTC is a distinct token representing a claim to actual bitcoin, similar to how paper money describes a claim to gold. The Liquid blockchain allows users to transact quickly and cheaply once they have L-BTC. They may use a peg-out transaction to exchange their L-BTC for actual bitcoin when they&#8217;re done trading.</p>



<p>Unlike Bitcoin&#8217;s blockchain, Liquid is administered by a federation of parties rather than being trustless and decentralized. As a result, the Liquid Network should be resistant to corruption due to its vast number of participants; however, the trust architecture is less secure than Bitcoin&#8217;s.</p>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Custodial services</strong></li></ol>



<p>Institutional investors who transact large amounts of bitcoin use custody solutions, which are third-party services that retain and secure tokens on their behalf. Online wallets and private keys can also store tokens, albeit they aren&#8217;t failsafe. As a result, intruders can obtain each user&#8217;s keys, which comprise complicated alphanumeric sequences that are tough to recall and utilize.</p>



<p>Online wallets are also attractive to hackers. Institutional investors&#8217; increased interest in the bitcoin ecosystem has prompted the development of custody solutions.</p>



<h2>Final words</h2>



<p>The off-chain platform has advantages for consumers, but it also has disadvantages. Nevertheless, off-chain platforms offer similar benefits across different solutions: lower costs and quicker transactions.</p>



<p>Off-chain platforms have different disadvantages. The Lightning Network, for example, needs funds to be locked up, and each payment channel&#8217;s capacity limits Lightning payments. The Liquid Network compromises part of Bitcoin&#8217;s trustlessness for peg-in transactions by requiring 100 confirmations. Custodial solutions put trustworthiness, transparency, and decentralization at risk.</p>



<p>These trade-offs should be considered while deciding between off-chain methods.</p>

<p>Investing in shitcoins has the potential to provide significant profits. For example, if you had invested in Shiba Inu, the second most popular shitcoin, you would have received a return of more than 20800000 percent by the end of the year.</p>



<p>Put another way, shitcoins can help you multiply your investment 1,000 times in the lowest period possible. However, remember that shitcoin values are considerably more likely to fall than skyrocket. Therefore, to take advantage of meme coins&#8217; massive value gains, it&#8217;s critical to identify and purchase the best shitcoins as soon as possible.</p>



<p>How can you locate the next big meme currency in a sea of shitcoins?</p>



<p>Based on our analysis of their future development potential, we&#8217;ve compiled a list of the best ten shitcoins to invest in for 2022.</p>



<h2>Top Shitcoins to keep an eye-on in 2022</h2>



<p>Cryptocurrencies and shitcoins are inextricably related. The hunt for the appropriate currency may appear challenging at first, but you could be wondering which shitcoins will be the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/top-cryptocurrencies-you-should-buy-and-hold-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">best investments in 2022</a>.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s take a closer look at the best shitcoins to buy right now to understand better what to expect in terms of token types in the future.</p>



<h3>1. <strong>Magic Internet Money </strong></h3>



<p>The first one on our list is Magic Internet Money which ranks at #2764 on CoinMarketCap, and its price as of this writing is about $1. Its coin – the MIM token – is a stable coin that can be exchanged for any other traditional stable coin in the market. So why is it a shitcoin? Very little is known about its founding team, its support on exchanges is low, and quite frankly – it has formidable competition that renders it irrelevant.</p>



<h3>2. <strong>SafeMoon</strong></h3>



<p>SafeMoon is a DeFi (Decentralized Finance) token. It was launched on 8th March of 2021. According to CoinMarketCap, SafeMoon ranks at #207 in the crypto market, with a capitalization capital of more than $1 billion.</p>



<p>The token was built on the Binance Smart Chain blockchain. Its protocol has three functions: reflection, liquidity pool acquisition, and burn.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This cryptocurrency made it in the news due to celebs like Logan Paul and rapper Lil Yachty showing interest. Its tagline – &#8216;Safely to the Moon&#8217; – too has contributed to its popularity. SafeMoon will soon launch its NFT and marketplace and a coin launchpad via which users can make their cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Investing in SafeMoon may be <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/money/is-safemoon-safe-2/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">riskier</a> than other shitcoins due to its low liquidity.</p>



<h3>3. <strong>Dogelon Mars</strong></h3>



<p>The following crypto token on our list is Dogelon Mars. A spin and fork of the infamous Dogecoin. This altcoin followed the steps of Dogecoin as a joke and eventually became a popular cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>Dogelon Mars (ELON) was released in April of 2021, while Dogecoin peaked in popularity. This was also the time when many new cryptos that replicated Dogecoin emerged. One of these was ELON, and it claimed to undo the damage caused by scam tokens.</p>



<p>In terms of market cap, Dogelon Mar&#8217;s token stands at #115 and has a market cap of $895 million in the crypto market as of 30th November.</p>



<h3>4. <strong>Baby DogeCoin</strong></h3>



<p>This shitcoin needs no introduction due to its prominent name that suggests it&#8217;s another clone of Dogecoin. The coin has been billed as being the progeny of its father- the Dogecoin.</p>



<p>As we have mentioned before, many cryptocurrencies were inspired by the idea of Dogecoin after it reported massive price <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/is-baby-dogecoin-cryptocurrency-worth-the-hype/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjM4dznisL0AhULTGwGHbUsCv0QFnoECAkQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw1SoC5clF0seKfbnwm1B7z0" data-wpel-link="internal">jumps</a> and, of course, the support of Elon Musk himself. For example, baby Dogecoin witnessed a 1,000% <a href="https://www.analyticsinsight.net/5-things-you-need-to-know-before-buying-baby-doge-cryptocurrency/" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">increase</a> in its price just two weeks after its launch in June 2021. Such a spike in the price of Baby Dogecoin can be attributed to Elon Musk&#8217;s tweets regarding the cryptocurrency. And in just 24 hours after his tweet, the cost of the cryptocurrency <a href="https://www.gobankingrates.com/investing/crypto/what-is-baby-dogecoin/" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">shot up</a> by 228.3%.</p>



<p>Upon research, you&#8217;ll find that this token states to have an improved transaction speed compared to the original meme coin.</p>



<h3><strong>5. Floki</strong></h3>



<p>One of the best shitcoins on the list is Floki Inu. Its name is inspired by Elon Musk&#8217;s pet dog named Floki. Looking at its rank in the crypto market, Floki Inu stands at position #2792 on CoinMarketCap in November of 2021.</p>



<p>The official Floki website says that supporters of the Shiba Inu made this cryptocurrency. Nonetheless, this shitcoin gained significant profits in only a few months. You can thank another one of Musk&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1437179881260032016?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">tweets</a>, showcasing his puppy &#8216;Floki&#8217; for this increase.</p>



<p>Regardless, this did not last long, as cryptocurrencies, especially meme coins, fluctuate a lot in the crypto market.</p>



<p>However, this token is associated with various projects that make it a bit different from your usual shitcoin. For example, Floki is officially partnered with millions of <a href="https://gardenmovement.com/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjCo6GLjML0AhXdSWwGHZGQB3UQFnoECAUQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw0NZNhf44hs3q5m1jux4AWy" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">Garden Movements</a> to solve food insecurity issues, run by Kimbal Musk (brother of Elon Musk).</p>



<p>Floki also has many upcoming flagship projects, including an education platform called Floki Inuversity, NFT, a metaverse NFT gaming Valhalla, and Flokiplaces (merchandise marketplace).</p>



<h3>6. <strong>Shiba Inu</strong></h3>



<p>Another token on this list, the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-to-buy-shiba-inu-coin-shib-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">Shiba Inu</a>, was established as a fun alternative to the present status quo. This shitcoin debuted in 2020, claiming to be the &#8220;Dogecoin slayer.&#8221; Unfortunately, the cryptocurrency has no underlying use cases, which is an excellent example of why it is now one of the top shitcoins.</p>



<p>Even though the definition of a shitcoin is debatable, <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/SHIB-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Shiba Inu</a> is unmistakably a meme token. Of course, even the finest shitcoins are hazardous, but Shiba Inu&#8217;s appeal is difficult to ignore.</p>



<p>Shiberse, Shiba Inu&#8217;s most recent effort, will likewise dabble in the metaverse. Shiberse will, according to the newest revelation, incorporate virtual real estate, allowing users to own land. Shibeverse will contain a total of 100,600 land parcels. Currency, Breed, Growth, and Technology will be the districts on this map. Users will be able to create and manage projects on their own.</p>



<h3>7. <strong>ApeCoin</strong></h3>



<p>The founders behind Bored Ape Yacht Club introduced <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/APE-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Apecoin</a> in 2022. This is a platform made up of 10,000 non-fungible Bored Ape one-of-a-kind tokens (NFTs). This marketplace sells some of the top NFTs, which are all based on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-to-buy-apecoin-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">ApeCoin</a> is an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that combines governance and usefulness. When it was initially released in March 2022, the price of this top shitcoin was roughly $6.50. However, APE coins sold for approximately $40 each within hours before crashing back to earth. Apecoin was trading at $17.75 within two days.</p>



<p>This meme currency has a market worth of roughly $3 billion. So whether you enjoy gaming or virtual world shopping, this is one of the greatest shitcoins to invest in.</p>



<h3><strong>8. 1Inch Network</strong></h3>



<p>Smart contract auditing specialists founded 1inch in 2020. At its core, 1inch is a decentralized exchange aggregator that allows you to compare prices for your money across several sites. The native token of the 1inch Network is 1Inch.</p>



<p>1Inch is a utility token as well as a governance token. As a token holder, you may participate in the future direction of the 1inch platform if you believe this is the best shitcoin to buy for your portfolio. 1inch Network has developed a unique protocol that distributes trade orders automatically.</p>



<h3>9. <strong>Samoyed Coin</strong></h3>



<p>Solana-based shitcoin Samoyed has a lot of potentials.</p>



<p>Samoyed Coin became one of the most frequently utilized shitcoins in May of 2021. Some of the fast-growing Solana ecosystem stars include Dogecoin, FTX exchange creator Sam Bankman-Fried, and Solana founder Anatoly Yakovenko.</p>



<p>These three firms and Solana&#8217;s growing popularity and user population will contribute to the top shitcoin&#8217;s price growth.</p>



<p>It appears that it missed the early 2021 market run, given its May 2021 launch. However, it proved its worth in November&#8217;s mini-rally, with a value gain of 1230 percent. The present value of SAMO is less than a tenth of its former peak.</p>



<h3>10. <strong>LuckyBlock</strong></h3>



<p>Like the other shitcoins on our list, Lucky Block has adopted a strategy in the hopes of winning community support and recruiting investors. The meme coin seeks to revolutionize online gaming and provide investors with double returns on their initial investment in two ways: gambling successes and meme coin value rises.</p>



<p>So far, it has amassed a following on social networking networks. Trading volumes have also surged, ranging from $1 to $16 million per day.</p>



<p>The meme money is still in the works. However, lucky Block has proved its endurance by maintaining a positive upswing and solid trade volumes in a decreasing market, despite being 75 percent lower in price than its peak.</p>



<h2>Final thoughts</h2>



<p>To wrap up, these were some of the top shitcoins that have surged in volumes due to sudden popularity. A common trend among many shitcoins is that they are simple replicas of well-known meme coins such as <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-dogecoin-how-to-buy-dogecoin-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">Dogecoin</a>. These tokens generally gain popularity after getting hyped by social media trends or endorsements by celebrities.</p>



<p>Essentially, shitcoins are bound to be volatile and have a similar tendency to meme coins. So what&#8217;s your viewpoint on shitcoins? Are they worth it? Comment down below!</p>

<p>Blockchain is gradually gaining traction as a technology. Although various peer-to-peer apps for file sharing, music streaming, and other services have existed for a long time, the concept that these networks may offer their security and resources has only been around since 2008. In the ten years since its conception, Blockchain has been chiefly associated with the success of bitcoin, the technology that gave birth to it.</p>



<p>However, it has swiftly established itself as a solo star in recent years. As the world&#8217;s favorite cryptocurrency rose in popularity, so did knowledge of the strange and unusual technology that underpins it. Developers who have realized the usefulness of <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/impact-of-blockchain-technology-on-leadership-and-management/" data-wpel-link="internal">Blockchain</a> are now rushing to come up with new applications and put their ideas into action.</p>



<h2>Need of Blockchain</h2>



<p>Many people believe that the fundamental benefit of Blockchain is its capacity to improve existing systems. However, astute observers noticed bitcoin&#8217;s promise since it offered a more secure and transparent payment processing and banking solution than existing options.</p>



<p>Blockchain has revolutionized various sectors in recent years, including cloud storage, smart contracts, crowdfunding, and even healthcare. However, the voting system is one of the most important sectors that Blockchain&#8217;s decentralized muscle can address.</p>



<h2>How is Blockchain helpful in the voting system?</h2>



<p>A blockchain is a digital ledger in its most basic form. The technology uses the peers- or nodes- on its network to validate, process, and record all transactions across the system. This ledger is never saved; instead, it resides on a &#8220;chain&#8221; backed by millions of nodes simultaneously. Thanks to encryption and decentralization, the Blockchain&#8217;s transaction database is incorruptible, and each record is easily verified. In addition, because the network does not exist in a single location, it cannot be shut down or affected by a single entity.</p>



<p>Blockchain may be used for data transfer, not only financial transactions. Because a vote is a little bit of high-value data, this system infrastructure is highly beneficial for voting. Modern voting methods are primarily trapped in the nineteenth century due to necessity. People who wish to vote must leave their houses and submit paper votes to a local government. Why not make this a web-based process? Some have attempted, but the findings have proven impossible to trust due to substantial security holes.</p>



<p>The various issues uncovered in these early attempts at online voting can be solved using Blockchain. Because any hacker with access to the terminal will not be able to impact other nodes, a blockchain-based voting program does not worry about the security of its Internet connection. Voters can cast their ballots without disclosing their identities or political views to the general public. Officials can tally votes with confidence since each ID can be linked to a single vote, no fakes can be made, and tampering is impossible.</p>



<h2>Benefits of integrating Blockchain into the voting process</h2>



<p><strong>Immutability</strong></p>



<p>Many experts believe that Blockchain Technology can help with online voting since the design provides an irreversible system. However, security and privacy are two critical components of online voting systems that bear the brunt of public expectations. The Bitcoin Blockchain, which is said to be the first widely known version of the technology, has never been tampered with.</p>



<p>A 51% attack becomes more complex and resourceful (and nonsensical) as the node chain grows longer. Blockchain can witness the elections and operate as a trusted agent because of its intimidating, god-like, and law-abiding image.</p>



<p><strong>Transparency</strong></p>



<p>A Blockchain voting software would, by definition, provide transparency in terms of certifying the integrity of the voting trail. Entries would be time-stamped and encrypted before being safeguarded with private keys in a blockchain-based e-voting system. While this may seem futuristic to baby boomers and Gen-X, the fact is that millennials and Gen-Z will control the forthcoming elections.</p>



<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong></p>



<p>The reliance on a centralized authority to safeguard cyberspace is immediately eliminated in a Blockchain e-voting system since the nodes are scattered randomly. Not to mention the additional levels of anonymity that the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/wazirx-p2p-how-it-works/" data-wpel-link="internal">peer-to-peer</a> network provides to the overall system. Electronic voting utilizing Blockchain might bring standard identifying techniques for individuals to protect the integrity of the election, such as 2-factor authentication.</p>



<h2>Final words</h2>



<p>Without a doubt, computerized and digital voting is the way of the future. And, Blockchain has the potential to improve a country&#8217;s voting methods significantly.</p>

<h2>Trading Fee Calculation</h2>



<p>There are two kinds of trades on WazirX:</p>



<ul><li>Spot Trade: For fee distribution according to coin, please visit:&nbsp; <a href="https://wazirx.com/fees" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">https://wazirx.com/fees</a>&nbsp;</li><li>P2P: No fee applicable.</li></ul>



<p>The effective trading fees you pay will be determined by the amount of WRX held by you on WazirX. The more WRX you hold, the lower your trading fees will be. Based on your WRX holding at the time of the trade, your trading fee rate will be determined as follows:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>WRX Holdings</strong></td><td><strong>Trading Fee Payable</strong></td></tr><tr><td>0-10 WRX</td><td>0.20%</td></tr><tr><td>10-200 WRX</td><td>0.17%</td></tr><tr><td>200-1000 WRX</td><td>0.15%</td></tr><tr><td>&gt;1000 WRX</td><td>0.10%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>For example, let’s say that you’re holding 250 WRX on WazirX, and you buy 100 USDT worth of BTC in the USDT market. In this case, you will have to pay a trading fee of 0.15% on this order, i.e., 0.15 USDT.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>



<ol><li><strong>After enabling the ‘Pay trading fee with WRX’ feature, how will my trading fees be calculated?</strong></li></ol>



<p>Suppose you traded in the BTC/USDT market, and the total fee calculated for this trade was 2 USDT, and the current market price of 1 WRX is 1 USDT. In this scenario, you will be paying 2 WRX as a trading fee.</p>



<p>2. <strong>After enabling the &#8220;Pay trading fee with WRX&#8221; feature, I have insufficient WRX in my account; what happens?</strong></p>



<p>In this case, you will pay fees in INR, USDT, or BTC, depending on the market you’re trading in.</p>



<p>3. <strong>I have WRX reserved for the trading fee as per unlock schedule, do I still have to enable this feature?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, WRX, as the fee will only be used if you have enabled this option.</p>

<p>The recent launch of ApeCoin has garnered attention in the cryptocurrency industry. After being airdropped to holders of the 10,000 Bored Ape Yacht Club and Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFTs, the token was launched in a loose affiliation with NFT hotspot Bored Ape Yacht Club, has been on the move, and has begun to trade on most of the major exchanges.</p>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-to-buy-apecoin-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">ApeCoin</a> is already one of the most valuable digital currencies, with approximately $5.8 billion. Is it just another meme coin, or will its high goals propel it even higher? ApeCoin&#8217;s future appears to be brighter. Let&#8217;s look at this meme coin to understand it better.</p>



<h2>Introduction to ApeCoin</h2>



<p>Ape Coin is an ERC-20 governance and utility token within the APE Ecosystem. This decentralized project was inspired by Yuga Labs&#8217; Bored Ape Yacht Club. The currency is now available for circulation in the APE Ecosystem.</p>



<p>On CoinMarketCap, Ape Coin is now ranked 35th among the top cryptocurrencies. ApeCoin DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization, manages APE. According to Yuga Labs, Ape Coin holders have governance powers over the DAO and its decision-making, as well as other benefits.</p>



<p>In March of this year, the BAYC launched APE. In the early days of its launch, APE was trading for around $8. BAYC NFT holders were first offered the opportunity to claim ApeCoin for free. The ApeCoin airdrop by YugaLabs caught the BAYC community off guard.</p>



<h2>The rise of the ApeCoin</h2>



<p>Ape Coin was first delivered as a reward to Bored Ape Yacht Club owners and Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFTs. Original Bored Apes owners received 10,094 tokens worth over $150,000 at current values. <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/the-pros-and-cons-of-nft-art/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFT holders</a> will get 15% of APE tokens, with the remaining 47% going to the DAO to help the project expand in the following years.</p>



<p>Ape Coin might become one of the top cryptocurrencies in 2022 if the price continues to grow, given the amount of media attention it has already received. However, as the price is still forming structure, it isn&#8217;t easy to generate meaningful projections based on technical analysis, as it is with all new coin offerings. ApeCoin&#8217;s principal application is a decentralized payment system.</p>



<p>The particular projects with which Ape Coin plans to collaborate are still unknown, while there are reports that the coin might be integrated into a variety of blockchain-based games. In addition, one of ApeCoin&#8217;s early investors, Animoca Brands, is planning to incorporate APE in a new project, helping boost demand for the currency.</p>



<h2>How is ApeCoin Distinctive?</h2>



<p>ApeCoin is the governance token for the APE Ecosystem, allowing token holders to participate in the ApeCoin DAO and providing a shared and open currency that can be utilized without centralized intermediaries. The Ecosystem Fund will receive 62% of all ApeCoin and fund community-driven activities determined by ApeCoin DAO members.</p>



<p>ApeCoin also gives users access to parts of the Ecosystem that would otherwise be restricted, like exclusive games and services. ApeCoin is a mechanism for third-party developers to join the Ecosystem by integrating ApeCoin into their services, games, and other projects.</p>



<p>The APE Foundation received a one-of-a-kind NFT from Yuga Labs, the makers of the Bored Ape Yacht Club. The APE Foundation has received full rights and privileges to this NFT and its accompanying artwork from Yuga Labs. Members of the ApeCoin DAO have control over how this intellectual property is used.</p>



<h2>Distribution of ApeCoin</h2>



<p>There are 1 billion ApeCoins in all. 14% will go to &#8220;launch contributors,&#8221; 8% to the BAYC founders, and 16% to Yuga Labs. Holders of BAYC and MAYC have been given a claim to 15% of the overall circulation, with the remainder going to the DAO&#8217;s &#8220;ecosystem fund.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to a statement, token holders will be eligible to vote on all community decisions. The DAO council will make all other exceptional decisions. Yuga Labs has also said that ApeCoin would be its primary cryptocurrency for products and services. Benji Bananas, Animoca Brands&#8217; blockchain game, also wants to include the currency within its design. ApeCoin DAO&#8217;s objective to exchange actual and virtual items is likewise centered on the token.</p>



<p>ApeCoin can be traded on other major exchanges. You can also trade ApeCoin <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/APE-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>



<h2>Can ApeCoin be considered a good investment?</h2>



<p>ApeCoin is a high-risk investment with the potential to provide massive profits. However, due to anticipation that Yuga Lab&#8217;s &#8220;Otherside&#8221; virtual land auction may be priced in APE, there is likely to be unusually significant volatility in the immediate term.</p>



<p>As a result, if extreme volatility persists, a sensible investor may wait for ApeCoin to settle before investing. Nonetheless, given BAYC&#8217;s popularity and strong demand from price-insensitive investors such as sportsmen and celebrities, it&#8217;s realistic to expect that investor demand for APE will expand if the BAYC ecosystem continues to thrive.</p>



<p>If you feel the BAYC ecosystem and Yuga Labs will continue to develop and surpass competitors, ApeCoin might be a rewarding method to profit from the Ecosystem&#8217;s rising value.</p>



<h2>What does the future of ApeCoin look like?</h2>



<p>The potential future of ApeCoin has sparked a lot of interest. For example, YugaLabs, the parent company of Bored Ape Yacht Club, recently acquired CryptoPunks and Meebits, two other major NFT projects. And if you look at ApeCoin&#8217;s plan, it&#8217;s apparent that they&#8217;re aiming to create an environment for their brands to connect and trade, using APE as the foundation token.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the founders&#8217; APE allotment is locked up for a year, so there is a strong incentive for them to increase the token&#8217;s value over the following year before selling or doing anything with it.</p>



<p>Lastly, many people seem to believe APE will be stakeable, which means you will be able to lock up part (or all) of your tokens and receive rewards. This might be a lucrative source of revenue for BAYC ecosystem HODLers.</p>

<h2><strong>Introduction to Wink coin</strong></h2>



<p>Previously known as TRONBet, WINk is a blockchain-based gaming platform built on the TRON network. The platform&#8217;s native token, Wink coin (WIN), is a TRC20-based utility token that can be used to place bets and conduct transactions. The <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/WIN-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Wink cryptocurrency</a>, which was trading between $0.0001 and $0.0005 for the large part of 2021, hit an all-time high in April 2021, when its price reached $0.002682. Although the coin has remained notably volatile since the beginning of 2022, several investors are bullish on the crypto’s future. Here’s why.</p>



<h2><a></a><strong>Is Wink coin a good investment?</strong></h2>



<p>As stated in its whitepaper, <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/WIN-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">WINk</a> aspires to be a project that benefits all stakeholders, including its developers, participants, and investors. And this is accomplished by granting WIN holders governance privileges, as well as offering gameplay discounts and other benefits to players who have also invested in the Wink cryptocurrency. Essentially, the <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/WIN-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">WINk platform</a> empowers developers to create great <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-dapps/" data-wpel-link="internal">DApps</a> through incentives like behavioral mining, innovative token economy design, and others.</p>



<p>Certainly, <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/WIN-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Wink coin</a> is a crypto with high potential. However, the future price of the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-cryptocurrency/" data-wpel-link="internal">cryptocurrency</a> could depend on the following factors:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Increased adoption of decentralized online gaming</strong></li></ul>



<p>As individuals across the world were forced to stay at home due to lockdowns, gaming quickly became one of the most popular ways to pass the time during the pandemic. The gaming industry&#8217;s exponential growth throughout the pandemic and the rise of blockchain-enabled decentralized gaming have shown that gaming is here to stay. WINk is a decentralized gaming platform seeking to break into this rapidly developing market. The popularity of decentralized platforms such as WINk due to its many services such as play-to-earn, staking, and HODLing is expected to drive up the <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/WIN-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">price of Wink coin</a>.</p>



<ul><li><strong>Securing partnerships with game developers</strong></li></ul>



<p>On the WINk platform, players are rewarded according to the protocols in the smart contracts that run each game, while investors are compensated through staking and capital gains. If the WINk project succeeds in attracting prominent developers who want to create more games on the Wink platform, demand for the token is expected to rise, resulting in higher prices for the Wink coin.</p>



<h2><a></a><strong>Wink coin price prediction; what does the future hold?</strong></h2>



<p>Wink coin is currently available for purchase in India through the WazirX app. At the time of writing, Wink (WIN) price in INR is $0.0002654 (<a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/WIN-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">₹0.0216</a>).</p>



<p><a href="https://coinpriceforecast.com/wink" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Coin Price Forecast</a> has predicted that Wink coin&#8217;s year-end value will be $0.0017 this year, with prices climbing to $0.0019 and $0.003 by 2023 and 2025, respectively. In contrast, in its five-year Wink price prediction, <a href="https://walletinvestor.com/forecast/win-prediction" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Wallet Investor</a> has forecasted that the Wink coin would hit $0.001 only in 2027. Although a prediction of $1, or Wink price in INR of ₹76.45 (exchange rate as of 27 April 2022) before the end of the year appears highly unlikely, due to the tremendous volatility of crypto markets, no one can be certain.</p>



<p>As a result, potential investors should always take Wink coin price predictions with a grain of salt and do extensive research before investing in the coin. It is important to remember that even expert forecasts are subject to error since they are largely based on the technical and fundamental analysis of a crypto&#8217;s performance. In the crypto market, past performance is not always indicative of future success.</p>



<p>Although <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/top-cryptocurrencies-you-should-buy-and-hold-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">cryptocurrencies</a> as a whole are extremely volatile, the price of <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/WIN-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Wink coin</a> may be affected by a number of factors in the future. There’s no certainty whether prices will go up or down. Investors interested in Wink coin are therefore advised to make investment decisions based on their market experience, risk appetite, investment portfolio spread, and the amount of money they can afford to lose.</p>

<p>Meme coins and NFTs are two of the hottest topics in the crypto world today. The Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) is probably one of the most prominent NFT collections around the world today. The team behind this famous Web3 project has successfully consolidated some of the most valuable NFT collections, including the Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), since its inception in April 2021.</p>



<p>Due to the massive popularity of the Bored Ape Yacht Club, its governance token, <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/APE-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">ApeCoin</a>, has been one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, with a market capitalization of $3.37 billion, since its launch in March 2022.  It serves all the communities related to the BAYC ecosystem, including the Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) and other NFT collections. ApeCoin fuels the governance of APE DAO &#8211; the DAO specifically created to look after the affairs of the BAYC/ApeCoin ecosystem.</p>



<p>As far as BAYC and MAYC are concerned, both stormed into the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/advantages-of-nft-tokens-for-indian-users/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFT</a> world by offering unique features beyond their attractive ape cartoons and are now considered the flagship NFT projects by many. Many celebrities, including Pris Hilton, Snoop Dogg, Jimmy Fallon, etc., are huge fans of BAYC and own the Bored Ape <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/a-guide-to-nfts/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFTs</a>.</p>



<p>Yuga Labs, the creator behind BAYC, recently acquired <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/11/22973394/bored-ape-yacht-club-cryptopunks-meebits-nft" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">two popular NFT projects, Meebits, and CryptoPunks</a>, from Larva Labs in March this year. Yuga Labs is the driving force behind the success of BAYC, and they have played a significant role in bringing together two of the most popular concepts of the crypto world, NFTs and meme coins, under one roof. Coinbase is also bringing its three-part movie series, <em>The Degen Trilogy,</em> in partnership with Tuga Labs, based on BAYC and MAYC.</p>



<h2><a></a>What is ApeCoin?</h2>



<p>ApeCoin is the governance and utility token of the Bored Ape Yacht Club community. In simpler terms, ApeCoin powers the Ape ecosystem. ApeCoin is a type of ERC-20 token. It is a type of build-it-yourself cryptocurrency based on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>



<p>APE crypto was created in March 2022 by a group of developers from Yuga Labs. Following the launch, all investors in the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), and all related NFT collections received the ApeCoin (APE) through an airdrop on 18th March.<em> &#8220;Introducing ApeCoin ($APE), a token for culture, gaming, and commerce used to empower a decentralized community building at the forefront of web3,” </em>the official Twitter handle of the ApeCoin said.</p>



<p>Due to the massive popularity of the Bored Ape Yacht Club brand, this airdrop has been one of the most anticipated in the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/the-pros-and-cons-of-nft-art/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFT</a> community. ApeCoin was launched by ApeCoin DAO. It is a new governing body composed of all APE holders. Its purpose is to collect community proposals, which token holders can then vote on. The supply of ApeCoin is limited to 1 billion.</p>



<p>The Ape Foundation handles day-to-day DAO administration, proposal management, and <em>&#8220;other tasks that ensure the DAO community&#8217;s ideas have the support they need to become a reality.&#8221;</em> It serves as ApeCoin DAO&#8217;s legal foundation. The board members of ApeCoin DAO are responsible for looking after certain kinds of proposals. This board consists of 5 high profile crypto experts:</p>



<ul><li>Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian</li><li>Head of FTX’s venture and gaming arm Amy Wu</li><li>Maaria Bajwa of Sound Ventures</li><li>Animoca Brands’ Yat Siu</li><li>Dean Steinbeck of Horizen Labs</li></ul>



<p>The board members&#8217; tenure is 6 months, and they hold the right to vote on the future board members.</p>



<h2><a></a>How does ApeCoin work?</h2>



<p>ApeCoin DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) in which all APE token holders can vote on governance issues. They have the authority to allocate funds to the Ape Ecosystem, establish governance rules, select projects and partnerships, and so on. After the DAO members vote on the proposals, the APE Foundation carries out the community-led governance decisions. ApeCoin employs a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to validate transactions on its blockchain.</p>



<p>The tokens are distributed to provide the ApeCoin DAO with continuous access to the Ape Ecosystem. <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/why-analysts-see-further-upside-in-this-multibagger-crypto-token/articleshow/90356175.cms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">62% of all apecoin are allocated to the Ape Ecosystem Fund</a>, which will support all community-driven initiatives that ApeCoin DAO members will vote on. ApeCoin also grants access to exclusive games and services in the ApeCoin ecosystem.</p>



<p>ApeCoin is used as a reward for players in Benji Bananas, a play-to-earn mobile game created by Animoca Brands. Benji Bananas provides a membership pass (&#8216;Benji Pass&#8217;), an NFT that allows its owners to earn special tokens when playing Benji Bananas and exchange those tokens for ApeCoin. With time <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/APE-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">ApeCoin</a> is expected to have more use cases.</p>

<h2><a></a>Future of ApeCoin</h2>



<p>ApeCoin currently has limited functionality other than membership in the ApeDAO, which oversees the governance of the <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/APE-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">ApeCoin token</a>. However, the future roadmap reveals that there will be utilities for token holders, particularly when combined with the underlying <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/a-guide-to-nfts/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFTs</a>.</p>



<p>ApeCoin DAO will gradually integrate the proposal and voting mechanisms into a full, on-chain platform in a form determined by the community. The <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/a-dive-into-decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao/" data-wpel-link="internal">DAO</a> will accomplish this by:</p>



<ul><li>Hiring DAO members to handle administrative, project management, and moderation tasks in place of the company&#8217;s appointed personnel</li><li>Putting together a community steering committee</li><li>Putting on-chain voting into action</li><li>Annual voting to select members of the DAO&#8217;s Board of Directors (the initial Board is in place for a shorter term of 6 months)</li></ul>



<p>ApeCoin is currently <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/all/views/all/" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">ranked 27</a> in the crypto world. Even though the price of Ape crypto at the time of writing is $19.67, it is expected that ApeCoin will <a href="https://changelly.com/blog/apecoin-price-prediction/" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">reach $50-$60</a> by the end of 2022. Therefore, the APE to INR rate is expected to increase as well. The team behind ApeCoin is continuously working on increasing the use cases of Ape crypto. Due to APE&#8217;s hype, it has seen a <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/03/19/why-apecoin-is-surging-again-today/" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">rise of over 1,305%</a> since its launch. Even in the long term, <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/APE-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">ApeCoin</a> is expected to profit due to the massive popularity of BAYC. The demand for Ape crypto will increase with the growth of the BAYC Ecosystem.</p>

<p>As one of the emerging asset classes, cryptocurrencies have been gaining global traction lately. With adoption rates reaching record-breaking levels, more and more people are showing interest in cryptocurrency investments and trading. While there are thousands of cryptocurrencies floating in the market, the one question that always comes to our mind before we begin investing is ‘which crypto to buy today for long term?’</p>



<p>To solve your indecision and confusion, here is the list of the 6 best <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/top-10-cryptocurrencies-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">cryptocurrencies to invest in 2022</a> for short term and long term: </p>



<p><em>(Market cap and price as on 20th April, 2022, on CoinMarketCap)</em></p>



<h2>#1 Bitcoin (BTC)</h2>



<p><strong>Market Cap: $787 billion</strong></p>



<p><strong>Price: $41,346&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Bitcoin remains the number one cryptocurrency by market cap. Despite the wide slumps and jumps in its prices since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin remains a favorite among institutions, businesses, and individuals. El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin as a legal tender and SEC’s approval of the Proshares Bitcoin ETF back in October 2021 proved to be a game changer for the crypto king. Bitcoin reached its ATH of $69,000 and continues to show resilience around the $40,000 mark.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The peer-to-peer payment network currently suffers from scalability issues and high gas fees. But the upcoming Lightning network will help in making bitcoin transactions instantaneous. With a growth of<a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/top-10-cryptocurrencies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"> over 9000% from 2016 to April 1, 2022</a>, Bitcoin continues to remain the best cryptocurrency to invest in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>#2 Ethereum (ETH)</h2>



<p><strong>Market Cap: $371 billion</strong></p>



<p><strong>Price: $3077</strong></p>



<p>The second-largest blockchain network <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-ethereum/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum</a> could be your answer to the question ‘ which cryptocurrency to buy today for the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/top-cryptocurrencies-to-consider-for-long-term-investments/" data-wpel-link="internal">long term</a>.&nbsp; Ethereum hosts over 80% of the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-dapps/" data-wpel-link="internal">dApps</a> and Defi platforms, has millions of NFTs built over it and houses a majority of the DAOs. Ethereum’s developer community is working hard to solve its scalability issues. Experts call Ethereum the highway to the web3 internet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ethereum is awaiting its Merge when it will shift from the PoW to the PoS consensus mechanism. In all probabilities, Ethereum is being considered undervalued and might explode in the coming months. It has experienced multi-bagger growth of over 31,000% from 2016 to 2022 and is the best cryptocurrency to invest in 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>#3 Solana (SOL)&nbsp;</h2>



<p><strong>Market cap: $35.5 billion</strong></p>



<p><strong>Price: $106</strong></p>



<p>Solana is a layer-1 scaling solution to the Ethereum network. It is the most popular smart contracts protocol after Ethereum, attracting more and more developers and investors alike. It uses the dual consensus mechanism of <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-whats-better/" data-wpel-link="internal">Proof of Stake</a> and Proof of History to validate transactions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It hosts over 1300 dApps and Defi platforms and can handle up to 50,000 transactions per second. Solana has registered a growth of 17,500% since its launch in 2020 and continues to remain the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/top-cryptocurrencies-you-should-buy-and-hold-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">best cryptocurrency to invest in 2022</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>#4 Terra (LUNA)</h2>



<p><strong>Market Cap: 33.7 billion</strong></p>



<p><strong>Price: $95</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/LUNA-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Terra</a> is a blockchain protocol that powers price-stable global payment systems via fiat-pegged stablecoins such as TerraUSD. Terra protocol combines the price stability and wide adoption of fiat and the decentralized censorship-resistant features of cryptocurrencies. It offers fast and economical settlement systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/LUNA-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Luna</a>, the native coin of the Terra platform, powers the platform and is used for minting stablecoins. Terra has recently been on a buying spree and has considerable amounts of Bitcoin and AVAX tokens in its treasury reserves. It can be a great choice for the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/best-cryptocurrencies-to-invest-in-india-for-short-term/" data-wpel-link="internal">best cryptocurrency to invest in short term in 2022</a> as stablecoins are gaining traction, and Terra itself as a platform has been actively seeking to widen its adoption and use cases. Luna witnessed a growth rate of 16,400% from January 3, 2021, to April 1, 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>#5 Cardano (ADA)</h2>



<p><strong>Market Cap: $31.6 billion</strong></p>



<p><strong>Price: $0.93&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/ADA-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Cardano</a> protocol is another popular Layer-1 scaling solution to the Ethereum network. Cardano is being considered the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/top-10-cryptocurrencies-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">best cryptocurrency to invest in 2022</a> for Ethereum’s upcoming Merge will likely lead to a spurt in the prices of the tokens of L1 and L2 scaling protocols. It offers high scalability and transaction speed and houses hundreds of dApps and Defi platforms on its network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It uses the Ouroboros Proof of Stake consensus mechanism to validate its transactions. It is one of the few platforms that publish its own peer-reviewed research and reviews and has a five-stage roadmap. It can handle 250 transitions per second. Since its inception in 2017, the <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/ADA-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">ADA token</a> has witnessed a growth rate of 5,750%, giving a staggering ROI of 16,000% to early investors.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>#6 XRP (XRP)</h2>



<p><strong>Market Cap: $35.86 billion</strong></p>



<p><strong>Price: $0.75</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/XRP-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">XRP</a> is a peer-to-peer network built to make global payments affordable for retail customers and banks. It charges very low transaction costs and offers less than 5 seconds of transaction finality. Ripple, the parent company of the XRP protocol, had been in troubled waters due to a lawsuit filed by the US SEC for non-compliance. Despite the tug-of-war proceedings, Ripple has greater chances of securing a win.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/XRP-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">XRP</a> facilitates the exchange of fiat and other major cryptocurrencies and holds umpteen potential as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in 2022.

<p>The crypto industry has expanded quickly, with discoveries and technologies like currencies, trading software wallets, and exchanges. Chainlink is one of the crypto world&#8217;s breakthroughs. Let&#8217;s have an overview of what Chainlink is and other related topics.</p>



<h2>What is Chainlink?</h2>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/LINK-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">ChainLink </a>is a decentralized oracle system. A chain (blockchain) is necessary to manage data in smart contracts. This situation greatly hampers their active dissemination. Furthermore, contractual agreements have no link to ordinary industries; thus, they cannot check the criteria stipulated in the contracts.</p>



<p>ChainLink oracles were built to interpret information from the outside into a format that the blockchain could understand. For example, suppose one of the criteria of a smart contract demands correct temperature information, a change in the status of a payment order, or pricing data for a specific period. In that case, the oracle will deliver it on the blockchain.</p>



<p>Oracles link digital contracts to the rest of the world. The breadth of smart contract applications will swiftly expand now that this possibility has surfaced. Many areas of the economy will be transformed due to the advancement of this technology.</p>



<h2>Problem solved by Chainlink</h2>



<p>Blockchains are fantastic because they employ math–cryptography, technical–to assure security, trust, and decentralization. The issue is that each blockchain is a separate reality.</p>



<p>The necessity to trust a source outside the blockchain to give correct information has always posed a risk when sending and receiving data.</p>



<p>To get information about event results or even the price of Bitcoin, you had to trust a source to speak the truth, not cheat, and not be compromised–creating a single point of failure. Chainlink is introduced here.</p>



<h2>Working of Chainlink</h2>



<p>Chainlink comprises two pieces that must communicate continually for the system to work correctly. The following are the two components:</p>



<ul><li>The internal blockchain, on which the node operators are</li><li>The external off-chain from which oracles obtain their data</li></ul>



<p>To comprehend how Chainlink works, you must first understand oracles. They&#8217;re the sensors that &#8220;live&#8221; outside of the blockchain. However, because they are digital DeFi devices, they are not in the real world. Instead, they serve as a link between the two ecosystems.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s say two blockchain nodes place a bet on a real-world event, such as a sporting event or the outcome of an auction or election. Then, they set the winning criteria in a smart contract and wait for the result from a third party (oracle).</p>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/difference-between-on-chain-off-chain-transactions/" data-wpel-link="internal">Off-chain</a> data owners can contribute their data to Chainlink via feeds or APIs provided by node operators.</p>



<p>A decentralized network of many off-chain oracles arises at this stage to give the needed information. They connect to the Ethereum blockchain independently of one another and communicate the data they have. They receive LINK tokens in exchange for providing accurate information.</p>



<p>None of the entities would be able to enter information onto the blockchain without the oracles, and the smart contract would never be completed.</p>



<h2>How to get hold of LINK tokens?</h2>



<p>The Chainlink network employs an ERC677 token based on the ERC-20 token standard and allows for data payloads in token transactions. It&#8217;s also used to pay data providers that bring and translate data onto the blockchain and are compensated by the data buyer. When data suppliers or oracles submit bids, they set the costs for their services.</p>



<h2>Pros &amp; Cons of Chainlink</h2>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<p>The chainlink cryptocurrency allows ETH and Bitcoin to collaborate, allowing payment providers like banks to participate. This is only one of the benefits of Chainlink; let&#8217;s look at the other benefits and drawbacks. One of Chainlink&#8217;s main goals is to decentralize smart contracts.</p>



<p>This will increase accuracy while also improving information security. Contract automation has been a focus of the SmartContract business, which created Chainlink, since 2014. Collaboration with significant corporations like Oracle, Google Cloud, and SWIFT boosts the project&#8217;s trust even further.</p>



<p>The LINK tokens are an excellent investment instrument due to their technological capabilities and the project&#8217;s long-term goals. The oracle network is in charge of creating a link between off-chain and blockchain transactions.</p>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<p>Chainlink is in grave peril. Chainlink is a fascinating endeavor that integrates on-chain and off-chain information by providing users with simple access to oracles and addressing one of the oracles&#8217; main issues: dependability. The majority of issues have been resolved due to its design, but it will be possible to increase its efficiency.</p>



<h2>Use Cases of Chainlink</h2>



<p>More complex smart contracts are being constructed utilizing Chainlink oracles, which provide high security and dependability assurances on par with the blockchain.</p>



<p><strong>Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</strong></p>



<p>Many traditional financial products, like loans, payments, derivatives, asset equity, and others, are being implemented on the blockchain with smart contracts to improve security and transparency while lowering entry barriers. These DeFi apps use Chainlink to price assets, obtain interest rates, check collateralization, and more, allowing them to do tasks like issuing a loan at fair market value, automating dividend issuance, and settling an options contract.</p>



<p><strong>Gaming</strong></p>



<p>On the blockchain, developers are also releasing smart contract-based gaming applications, which frequently include non-fungible tokens (NFT) as scarce digital collectibles. Many blockchain games require a source of randomness to produce unpredictable in-game events or choose the lucky winner of rewards. VRF is a randomness solution provided by Chainlink that creates randomness and distributes it to smart contracts so that users can establish it is fair and impartial, as neither players, game developers, or other entities can tamper with or manipulate the randomness to their benefit.</p>



<h2>Future of Chainlink</h2>



<p>One of the most advanced features of Chainlink&#8217;s subsequent releases will be off-chain networks built on top of oracles. Off-chain networks are designed to relocate most of the smart contract platform&#8217;s complicated computing processes away from the primary layer.</p>



<p>Ethereum&#8217;s gas costs, for example, have been growing in response to increased demand for processing power, threatening to render the network unusable for smaller transactions. By making the computing process for DApps more economical and easy, Chainlink 2.0 seeks to assist customers in overcoming this challenge.</p>



<h2>Final words</h2>



<p>Chainlink is one of the top applications in the crypto market for converting off-chain sources to smart contracts on the blockchain. It offers a variety of benefits to consumers while also posing specific hazards. Before investing money in crypto, one must thoroughly understand digital currency, as it correlates to highly variable rates.</p>

<h2>Chainlink (LINK)</h2>



<p><strong>Market cap (in billions):</strong> $5.25</p>



<p><strong>Rank:</strong> #26</p>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/LINK-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Chainlink</a> is a decentralized oracle network that aims to play a key role in the practical adoption of blockchain technology. This network aims to provide inputs from various external data sources. </p>



<p>LINK is the native token of Chainlink designed to fund the project&#8217;s growth. Given blockchain’s growing relevance in real-world use cases, LINK tokens could be one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in the short term. Similar to Bitcoin (<a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/BTC-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">BTC</a>) and Ethereum (<a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/ETH-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">ETH</a>), <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/LINK-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">LINK</a> is built on its own blockchain and encourages the process of mining among its users. The LINK token is used to reward Chainlink network operators when they retrieve data from off-chain feeds, format the data into accessible formats, and perform several off-chain calculations. </p>



<p>In particular, Chainlink is being used to distribute non-fungible tokens (<a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/a-guide-to-nfts/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFTs</a>), bet on personal savings, and facilitate the readjustment of cryptocurrency token distribution.</p>



<h2>Polkadot (DOT)</h2>



<p><strong>Market cap (in billions):</strong> $14.98</p>



<p><strong>Rank</strong>: #14</p>



<p>Polkadot is a next-generation <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/blockchain-explained/" data-wpel-link="internal">blockchain</a> protocol that connects multiple specialized blockchains to an integrated network. The <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/DOT-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Polkadot</a> protocol is designed to be fast and scalable, with transactions going on simultaneously on parallel blockchains (or “parachains&#8221;). This removes most of the processing requirements of major blockchains, adding unprecedented levels of scalability and speed to the DOT network. Once fully functional, <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-polkadot/" data-wpel-link="internal">Polkadot</a> will be able to process <a href="https://cryptonews.com/coins/dot-polkadot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">over 1,000,000 transactions per second</a>. And all of this remains truly decentralized.</p>



<p>DOT is the native and governance token of Polkadot. DOT allows the holders to vote on decisions related to the future of the network. DOT is also used for staking on the Polkadot network for validating transactions and issuing new DOTs. DOT can be bought and sold on exchanges like <a href="https://wazirx.com/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">WazirX</a> along with all the best cryptocurrencies to invest in 2022 for a short term.</p>



<h2>Binance Coin (BNB)</h2>



<p><strong>Market cap (in billions)</strong>: $64.20</p>



<p><strong>Rank</strong>: #4</p>



<p>The Binance Exchange is primarily known for cryptocurrency-to-cryptocurrency trades (transactions between two cryptocurrency pairs). It implements high-security standards with multi-tiered and multi-cluster architectures and provides users with one of the best trading experiences. It claims to be capable of processing <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/binance-coin-bnb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">approximately 1.4 million transactions per second</a>. Binance also allows the investors to trade at one of the lowest transaction fees in the crypto sphere. </p>



<p>Binance reduces transaction fees by 50% on its network when the transaction fee is paid in its native cryptocurrency, Binance Coin (BNB). This means that if you were about to pay 10 cents for a $100 transaction, you need to pay 5 cents only if you complete the transaction with BNB. This surely makes BNB one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in for the short term.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Binance Coin strengthens the Binance ecosystem. BNB has multiple use cases like executing transactions on the chain, paying transaction fees on Binance Exchange, paying in stores, and many more. Moreover, as stated in the Binance white paper, <a href="https://www.gfinityesports.com/cryptocurrency/bnb-burn-schedule-next-binance-coin-burn-date-how-much-bnb-burned-meaning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">Binance uses 20% of its profits</a> to buy back, burn and destroy Binance coins quarterly to keep the prices deflationary. </p>



<h2>Cardano (ADA)</h2>



<p><strong>Market cap (in billions)</strong>: $28.09</p>



<p><strong>Rank</strong>: #9</p>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/2022-cardano-outlook/" data-wpel-link="internal">Cardano is a decentralized Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain</a>. It is the first blockchain to be based on peer-reviewed research. Cardano aims to improve the problem of scalability and other inefficiencies of the Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocol used in major cryptocurrency networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Cardano Foundation that strengthens the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-to-buy-cardano-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">Cardano</a> network has partnered with many academic institutions to review and research every aspect of the blockchain. ADA is the native cryptocurrency of the Cardano ecosystem. It is the first 3rd generation cryptocurrency and one of the best <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/top-cryptocurrencies-you-should-buy-and-hold-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">cryptocurrencies</a> to invest in for the short term. </p>



<p>Third-generation cryptocurrencies usually take examples from first and second-generation cryptocurrencies and improve their limitations. In particular, Cardano aims to solve issues related to the scalability, interoperability, and sustainability of other cryptocurrency platforms. To develop versatility, Cardano plans to leverage new advances over the years, such as security, sustainability, and multi-tiered architecture.</p>



<p>So this was our list of the 5 best cryptocurrencies to invest in 2022 for the short term. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced investor in cryptocurrencies, WazirX could be your go-to choice.</p>

<h2>1. What is the future of crypto in India?</h2>



<p>The future of <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/BTC-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">cryptocurrency in India</a> is a complex issue. Currently, the Indian Government has not yet granted the status of legal tender to crypto assets. However, in the latest developments regarding cryptocurrencies in the country, the Government has put cryptocurrencies in the 30% taxation slab. This indicates that the Government, for now, is testing the potential of the future of cryptocurrencies in India. </p>



<p>Over the years, the stand of the Government has softened on the crypto assets. The Government has scheduled to introduce a crypto regulation bill in the parliament that will seal the future of Bitcoin in India in 2022 and other crypto assets. Financial experts interpret that by putting the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-cryptocurrency/" data-wpel-link="internal">cryptocurrencies</a> in the highest tax bracket in the country, the Government is hinting investors to exercise caution till regulatory norms are introduced in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Importantly, the Government has announced to introduce digital Rupee, which will be issued and backed by the Reserve bank of India (RBI), just like the fiat currency. This shows that the Government is receptive to the changing global currency system and aims to include digitized currency options in the economic framework in India.</p>



<h2>2. Is Cryptocurrency legal in India?</h2>



<p>With more than 10 million active <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/things-to-consider-before-investing-in-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin investors</a> in India, bitcoin and crypto transactions are unquestionably legal. Anyone can purchase, sell, or exchange cryptocurrencies under current legislation. They are, however, unregulated, as the Indian Government is still drafting a framework regarding regulations of cryptocurrencies, and as of now, there is no regulatory system in place for digital currencies. On the other hand, several crypto exchanges have not only self-regulated in compliance with KYC standards and enforced these for their users, but they have also aided the Government in evaluating its possibilities regarding the future of cryptocurrencies in India.</p>



<h2>3. Is it safe to invest in Cryptocurrency?</h2>



<p>Cryptocurrency does have risks of market volatility and loss for investors, but this is because cryptocurrencies are largely unregulated. Due to the decentralized and public nature of its distributed ledger technology, the very foundation of cryptocurrencies, which is built on blockchain technology, is inherently secure. Every transaction, therefore, not only has a highly secure encryption process, but they&#8217;re also untraceable. As a result, Bitcoin and other crypto transactions are far more secure than online banking, money transfers through digital wallets, or peer-to-peer payment platforms.</p>



<h2>4. Can I convert Bitcoin to cash in India?</h2>



<p>Yes, you can convert <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/BCH-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Bitcoin to Cash</a> in India. India provides one of the most profitable <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/why-wazirx-best-bitcoin-trading-platform-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin trading</a> opportunities for Bitcoiners all over the world. If you play your card right, you can easily earn a fortune. Here’s how you can convert Bitcoin to cash in India.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Register yourself on any prominent <a href="https://wazirx.com/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">crypto exchange</a> which lists the BTC/INR trading pair. For example, WazirX is the most prominent crypto exchange and lets you convert your Bitcoin to fiat currency quite easily. </li><li>Transfer your Bitcoin to the wallet of the exchange you’ve chosen.</li><li>Once you’ve transferred, go to the trading page of the exchange platform and search for BITC/INR trading pairs. Then, enter details on the amount and rate at which you want to sell your Bitcoin and click on the “Sell” button.</li><li>After you’ve sold it, you can withdraw INR to your bank account, and the process is done.</li></ul>



<h2>5. Which Cryptocurrency will grow the most in 2022?</h2>



<p>Although Bitcoin has consistently dominated the crypto market for over a decade now, several other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, Litecoin, etc., have seen immense growth. Even joke coins like Dogecoin have become wildly prominent. So, instead of solely thinking about the future of Bitcoin in India 2022, you should also look forward to other potential crypto coins. So, here are the top 5 cryptocurrencies that will see maximum growth in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Ethereum</strong> – Market capitalization: US$342 billion</p>



<p><strong>Tether</strong> – Market capitalization: US$83 billion</p>



<p><strong>Binance Coin</strong> – Market capitalization: US$64 billion.</p>



<p><strong>USD Coin – </strong>Market capitalization:<strong> </strong>US$49 billion<strong>Ripple</strong> – Market capitalization: US$30 billion</p>



<h2>6. Is Bitcoin taxable in India?</h2>



<p>Yes, <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/why-wazirx-best-bitcoin-trading-platform-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">crypto gains</a> will be taxable in India in the following manner from April 2022:</p>



<ul><li>30% tax will be levied on all the profits made from a crypto transaction.</li><li>Cryptocurrencies received as gifts will invite tax. This will have to be paid by the receiver.</li><li>A 1% tax deducted by source (TDS) will be charged.</li></ul>



<p>More clarity on the taxation on crypto is awaited.</p>



<h2>7. Is it smart to invest in Ethereum?</h2>



<p>RBI has been one of the most vocal entities in opposition to the circulation of cryptocurrencies in the Indian markets. While the Supreme Court has ruled against RBI&#8217;s circular of 2018, where the banks were directed to dissuade their customers from <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/why-wazirx-best-bitcoin-trading-platform-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">investing in cryptocurrencies</a>, position holders in RBI still voice their concern over the future of cryptocurrencies in India. However, with the Government&#8217;s proposal of a crypto regulation bill in late 2021, RBI has been on its toes to understand the impact on crypto and digital assets in the country.</p>



<p>In January 2021, RBI set up two departments to oversee the drafting of regulations for fintech and cryptos in the country and to work on its digital currency. This is a relief to the people who invested in cryptocurrencies and is also hopeful for millions across the country who are awaiting the final decision on cryptocurrency regulation in India.</p>



<h2>8. What is the RBI’s latest stand on cryptocurrency in India?</h2>



<p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently issued an important clarification on cryptocurrencies stating that banks cannot use the April 2018 circular of the RBI to warn their consumers against <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/why-wazirx-best-bitcoin-trading-platform-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">cryptocurrency trading</a>. This clarification comes after institutions such as the State Bank of India, and HDFC Bank issued warnings to their customers about dealing in virtual currencies, citing the RBI&#8217;s April 2018 regulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the Supreme Court eventually overturned this ruling in 2020, it appeared that some of these banks were informing consumers that failing to follow this guideline might result in their cards being canceled or suspended. This clarification gives relief to the people who invested in cryptocurrencies and is also hopeful for millions across the country who are awaiting the final decision on cryptocurrency regulation in India. </p>



<h2>9. What is the future of Bitcoin in India?</h2>



<p>The future of <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/BTC-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Bitcoin in India</a> in 2022 looks promising with the introduction of tax laws in the country. However, more laws regarding regulations of cryptocurrencies are expected in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Again, it is crucial to emphasize that although the Government&#8217;s stance on cryptocurrencies has softened, it can still introduce strict laws. This is because digital currencies are an area where Governments across the world are still trying to ascertain their impact on the economy. So in a developing nation like India, strict norms might be introduced to test the potential of a digital currency model.</p>



<h2>10. Which is the best exchange to invest in cryptocurrency in India?</h2>



<p>WazirX is, without a doubt, India’s best crypto trading platform. It is not only India’s fastest-growing cryptocurrency exchange but also the safest and most trustworthy cryptocurrency trading platform and boasts over 1,300,000 users. You can buy and sell <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/BTC-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Bitcoin</a>, <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/XRP-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Ripple</a>, <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/ETH-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Ethereum</a>, <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/TRX-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Tron</a>, <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/LTC-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Litecoin</a>, and various other cryptocurrencies through WazirX.

<p>It’s a surreal timeline in which fundamentals and everything else that makes sense don’t appear to have a part in asset pricing. The most outlandish and unusual notion often succeeds, with no justification as to why. But, unlike fiction, it isn’t required to make sense in reality. Meme coins are valued based on how much people value them in the most basic way imaginable. Therefore, the meme coin price in India goes up and down according to its popularity.<br><br>They don’t claim to do anything and admit they’re only there for the laughs. You may spend all day debating the merits of meme coins, or you can embrace the dark side and profit off them. In this article, we will give you a complete guide to finding out the best meme coin to buy in India and where to buy meme coins in India. Let’s look at the top 5 meme coins as of April 2022.</p>



<p><em>(All data regarding the rank and market cap of the cryptocurrencies are according to CoinMarketCap as of 4 May 2022)</em></p>



<h2>1. Dogecoin</h2>



<p>Market cap (in billions): $17.41</p>



<p>Rank: #12</p>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/DOGE-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Dogecoin</a> was the first meme coin released in 2013. The Dogecoin network is a hard fork of Litecoin. The dog-themed token had declined until 2021. It began to skyrocket in 2021, rising more than 20,000% in a single year while being widely promoted by Elon Musk. Doge is <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/view/memes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">first among the current top 5 meme coins</a>, besides being one of the top cryptos by market cap! It has an almost limitless supply, but that’s a topic for another day. Doge wasn&#8217;t the best-performing cryptocurrency of 2021. However, It was the <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/11/19/3-most-searched-cryptocurrencies-in-us-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external">most searched cryptocurrency in 2021</a> in the USA. This meme coin price in India is expected to increase with its growing popularity.<br><br>Dogecoin has constantly been upgrading its use cases. In December 2021, the Dogecoin Foundation announced the addition of a &#8220;Dogepedia&#8221; on its website to answer all questions regarding Dogecoin. The founders are also working on a GigaWallet that will allow more merchants around the globe to accept Dogecoin as a payment option. With new upgrades, Dogecoin is expected to hold its crown as the best meme coin to buy in India.</p>



<h2>2. Shiba Inu</h2>



<p>Market cap (in billions): $11.33</p>



<p>Rank: #15</p>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/SHIB-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Shiba Inu</a>, the 2nd largest meme currency on our list and the self-proclaimed DOGE killer, is another community-driven dog-themed token. Its official website describes SHIB as <em>“ an experiment in decentralized spontaneous community development.”</em> The total supply of SHIB tokens is 1,000,000,000,000,000 (or 1 quadrillion). This project is named after a Japanese hunting dog breed called Shiba Inu. It is based on the Ethereum blockchain.<br><br>It <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/shiba-inus-jump-here-is-why/" data-wpel-link="internal">momentarily surpassed Dogecoin</a> in market capitalization but is back to tailing DOGE again (possibly just for a short time!). It is also the most promising meme coin in the Shiba Inu ecosystem that offers two other cryptocurrencies named LEASH and BONE other than SHIB. The Shiba Inu community has set up the platform’s DEX &#8211; ShibaSwap and plans to set up an NFT marketplace and other Defi-based applications.  Given the upcoming use cases of Shiba Inu, it is surely one of the best meme coins to invest in 2022.</p>



<h2>3. Safemoon</h2>



<p>Market cap (in millions): $763.34</p>



<p>Rank: #215</p>



<p>In March 2021, SafeMoon was released with the  motto, <em>“Safely to the Moon”,</em> inspired by the common expression <em>“to the moon,</em>” meaning <em>“to grow in value swiftly.&#8221;</em> John Karony, a former analyst for the US Department of Defense, is the current CEO of SafeMoon. SafeMoon swiftly surpassed one million cryptocurrency holdings soon after its inception. SafeMoon is one of the most popular meme coins with the most potential today.<br><br>After a slew of celebrity endorsements, including rapper Lil’ Yachty, YouTuber Logan Paul, and sports blogger Dave Portnoy, SafeMoon’s worth skyrocketed. It is a meme coin in the same vein as Shiba Inu is. SafeMoon is the epitome of why establishing a product first is so important. Anyone who sells safemoon coins will be hit with a 10% fee. Half of this fee will be paid by way of a dividend to current investors. The idea behind this sale penalty is <em>&#8220;to discourage day trading and iron out the significant price volatility suffered by other cryptocurrencies&#8221;</em>.</p>



<h2>4. Dogelon Mars (ELON)</h2>



<p>Market cap (in millions): $499.21</p>



<p>Rank: #120</p>



<p>The meme coin Dogelon Mars (ELON) is themed on Dogecoin (DOGE) and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. In 2021, the coin had massive price swings, and some feel it still has space to expand. This Ethereum-based project uses the ERC-20 token standard, which implies it uses the Ethereum network for security while also adding its own distinctive features to the token. <br><br>The founders of Dogelon Mars have <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dogelon-mars-price-prediction-2022-092551495.html" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">trapped 50% of all ELON</a> liquidity in the Uniswap liquidity pool. The other half was donated to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. The donated ELON was sent to various DAOs and foundations. Current token holders either bought the asset on the Decentralized Exchange (DEX) or received it as a donation from Vitalik Buterin.</p>



<h2>5. Kishu Inu</h2>



<p>Market cap (in millions): $89.91 (self-reported)</p>



<p>Rank: #2981</p>



<p>Kishu Inu, which debuted in August 2020, bills itself as a meme currency. One can credit Kishu Inu&#8217;s initial popularity to Dogemania. However, it is expected to gain a considerable following of its own.  Kishu Inu&#8217;s founders have stated that they want to be the first meme money with real-world applications rather than relying on public relevance. Kishu Inu is a deflationary currency that rewards investors who purchase more coins.<br><br>As the meme coin trend continues, we can expect to see more of these altcoins emerge and gain popularity, and meme coin prices in India are soaring further. Furthermore, since the emphasis on real-world use is more dominant than ever, creators can also be expected to add in some utility features. </p>



<p>If you&#8217;re wondering where to buy meme coins in India, then <a href="https://wazirx.com/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">WazirX</a> is the best choice for you. We hope the above guide will help you choose the best meme coin to invest in 2022. Happy Investing!</p>

<p>Bitcoin is certainly the most popular <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-cryptocurrency/" data-wpel-link="internal">cryptocurrency</a> in the world right now, and India stands to benefit considerably from this revolutionary technology. However, citizens are still confused about whether cryptocurrency is legal in India. We have traveled a long way since the banking ban on cryptos in 2018. While a cryptocurrency bill is still in the pipeline, the Government initiated a series of discussions with the stakeholders in the crypto industry in 2021. The Union budget speech could be called a landmark in the history of cryptocurrency in India as, for the first time, the Government proposed taxing cryptos, legitimizing them (if not legalizing them). However, we still need further clarity on the Government’s stance on cryptos.</p>



<p>However, to answer the pressing questions, including &#8220;<a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/is-bitcoin-legal-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">Is Bitcoin Legal in India</a> in 2022?&#8221; and to clear any confusion regarding the cryptocurrency&#8217;s taxation status in India, we have answered the nine most frequently asked questions surrounding Bitcoin&#8217;s legal status in India.</p>



<h2>Q1- Is it legal to buy Bitcoin in India?</h2>



<p>Yes, Bitcoin is 100% legal in India. No clear laws and regulations exist to monitor Bitcoin as of April 2022, but the Government has imposed a 30% flat rate of crypto tax on gains from the transfer of cryptocurrencies in India. Despite the tax implication, the legality aspect of Bitcoin and cryptos hasn’t yet been discussed. However, it doesn&#8217;t mean that you can&#8217;t trade in cryptocurrencies legally. Exchanges like WazirX operate on self-imposed regulations, where one is held to the same standards as a traditional exchange.</p>



<h2>Q2- How do I ensure that my Bitcoin is stored safely?</h2>



<p>To store your bitcoins, you have two options: cold wallets or hot wallets. Hot wallets are online <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/best-bitcoin-wallet-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">wallets</a> connected to the internet and are convenient for transactions but are a little less secure when compared to cold wallets. Hot wallets are usually not recommended for storing large amounts of bitcoins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alternatively, cold wallets are a safer option for safely storing your bitcoins, as they are offline wallets or hardware wallets. You can <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/hot-wallets-vs-cold-wallets-whats-the-difference" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">read more</a> about these wallets to secure your bitcoin storage and prevent it from scams.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Q3- What are the legal procedures to buy bitcoin in India?</h2>



<p>If you are wondering, is it legal to <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-to-buy-bitcoin-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">buy Bitcoin in India</a>? Here are the legal procedures to <a href="https://wazirx.com/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">buy bitcoin in India</a> are as follows:</p>



<ol><li>The first step is to register yourself on a trusted crypto exchange platform. It is the most crucial step as you have to choose the most reliable and trustworthy <a href="https://wazirx.com/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">crypto exchange platform</a> for safe and secure trading. One such reliable and most trusted crypto exchange is <a href="https://wazirx.com/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">WazirX</a>.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<ol start="2"><li>After registering, you have to verify your KYC by providing legal documents such as a pan card, an Aadhaar card, etc. Again, it is recommended that you choose an exchange with proper KYC and AML procedures to ensure 100% legal compliance.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<ol start="3"><li>Add your bank details and UPI details to the crypto exchange and wait once all the verification completes.&nbsp;</li><li>Lastly, you can add money to your trading account via your bank and then use it to <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/BTC-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">buy bitcoin</a> on the crypto exchange.&nbsp;</li></ol>



<h2>Q4- What are the Government&#8217;s views on buying or selling Bitcoin?</h2>



<p>The Government has concerns over using <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a> for making payments for illicit activities such as money laundering, tax evasion, terrorism financing, etc. The Government intends to prevent the illegal usage of cryptocurrencies. However, as we’ve discussed in a recent post, <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/blockchain-explained/" data-wpel-link="internal">blockchains</a> can be excellent forensic tools to catch malicious actors.</p>



<p>RBI is planning to issue a digital rupee in the FY 2022-2023. Besides this, the Government has proposed some tax provisions regarding the sale/purchase/transfer of cryptocurrencies in the Union Budget of 2022.<br>New tax rates have been imposed on the transfer of digital assets, which includes Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The budget also explains what constitutes digital assets. A digital asset will include <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/readersblog/blockchaintalk/indian-government-has-defined-crypto-as-virtual-digital-asset-41081/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"><em>‘any information or code or number or token (not being Indian currency or any foreign currency), generated through cryptographic means.’ </em></a>The digital asset may be exchanged with or without consideration. </p>



<h2>Q5- What are the taxation policies for Bitcoin in India?</h2>



<p>Cryptocurrency taxation in India was one of the most confusing aspects when <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-to-buy-bitcoin-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">buying bitcoins</a>. Earlier, neither the Income Tax Act nor the GST act defined cryptocurrencies. However, in the <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/cryptocurrency-tax-news-budget-2022-live-updates-tds-rules-crypto-income-taxation-regulation-for-investors/2421636/#:~:text=crypto%20tax%20regime!-,IN%20Budget%202022%2D22%2C%20the%20Government%20took%20a%20conservative%20stand,transfer%20of%20virtual%20digital%20assets." data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">2022 Union Budget</a>, FM Nirmala Sitharaman proposed a tax regime for digital assets, including cryptocurrencies.</p>



<ul><li>Anyone holding Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies in India would be required to report their gains or losses from the digital assets as a part of their income.</li><li>A flat 30% tax will be charged on the income from the transfer of digital assets.&nbsp;</li><li>1% TDS will be deducted on the payment by the buyer if the amount crosses the threshold limit.&nbsp;</li><li>Cryptocurrency is subject to be taxed at the recipient’s end if received as a gift or transferred.</li><li>The loss from virtual asset investment cannot be offset against any other income.</li></ul>



<p>The provisions are applicable from April 1, 2022. However, more clarity is expected soon.</p>



<p> </p>



<h2>Q6- What is the minimum amount needed to buy Bitcoins in India?</h2>



<p>It depends on the <a href="https://wazirx.com/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">cryptocurrency exchange</a>. While the <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/BTC-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">price of a Bitcoin</a> may be in tens of lakhs, you have the option to buy a fraction of bitcoin for as low as INR 100. For example, <a href="https://wazirx.com/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">WazirX</a> allows you to <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/BTC-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">buy Bitcoin</a> for as low as INR 100.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Q7- Is Bitcoin mining legal in India?</h2>



<p>The legal status of <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-bitcoin-mining/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin mining</a> is not clear in India and still faces uncertainty. Mining Bitcoin requires a lot of energy, and it consumes about 60 terawatt-hours annually. But the <a href="https://bitsonline.com/india-govt-bans-imining-gear/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">government practically banned the import of ASIC machines in India in 2017</a>.</p>



<p>A ban on ASIC machines leaves the miners with GPU mining, which is an energy-intensive process and is not a desirable option considering the high electricity costs and low efficiency. In fact, Bitcoin miners have abandoned GPU mining altogether, as it is deemed to be unprofitable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Q8- What legal steps should be taken to safeguard against Bitcoin fraud and scams?</h2>



<p>Here are a few steps to consider before deciding to <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/things-to-consider-before-investing-in-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">invest in Bitcoin</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>There are various fake crypto exchange platforms out there, and there is a need to do market research before buying bitcoins from an exchange platform. Stick to reliable and trusted <a href="https://wazirx.com/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">crypto exchange</a> platforms such as WazirX.&nbsp;</li><li>Make sure to safely store your bitcoin in an offline wallet for better security.&nbsp;</li><li>Make sure you set up two-factor authentication for your online crypto-wallets.</li><li>Never share your private key or login credentials with anyone.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<h2>Q9-Will Bitcoin be accepted as a legal mode of payment?</h2>



<p>Globally, many use crypto assets as a mode of payment due to easy global transfer and lower transaction costs than bank transfers. However, the Government of India does not grant cryptocurrencies or Bitcoin the status of a legal tender. <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/cryptocurrency-tax-news-budget-2022-live-updates-tds-rules-crypto-income-taxation-regulation-for-investors/2421636/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">And we might not see the Government doing it anytime soon. </a> In 2022, the Government has taken the initial steps of regulating cryptocurrencies via the proposed tax regime. Despite the positive steps by the Government, <a href="https://www.financialexpress.com/budget/cryptocurrency-tax-news-budget-2022-live-updates-tds-rules-crypto-income-taxation-regulation-for-investors/2421636/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">L Badri Narayanan, a legal expert, states that<em> ‘the recognition of digital assets under income tax is not akin to granting legal status.’ </em></a>  Notwithstanding the above fact, thousands of global e-commerce merchants accept Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as payment.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>We hope this guide answered a few of your questions regarding the legal status of cryptocurrency and whether it is legal to <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/BTC-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">buy Bitcoin in India</a> in 2022 or not.

<p>Are you interested in investing in gaming coins? Then, you&#8217;ve come to the correct spot if you&#8217;re seeking the top gaming cryptocurrency coins to invest in 2022. This article has evaluated the top ten gaming currencies with promising futures.</p>



<p>The gaming business has achieved an all-time high globally thanks to the lockdowns and stay-at-home mandates stemming from the COVID-19 outbreak. As a result, the metaverse and virtual and crypto gaming platforms with comprehensive AR/VR experiences are being developed. As a result, individuals can not only play games on these platforms and in the metaverse, but they can also explore on their own, build their story arcs, acquire real estate, collect collectibles, battle monsters, etc.</p>



<p>To perform any of them, you&#8217;ll need digital currency, which you may use to transact and buy a digital collection or have a wonderful experience. As a result of the heavenly marriage of the gaming sector and the blockchain network, gaming cryptocurrencies – coins and tokens – have emerged as game-changers in the current crypto environment.</p>



<p><strong>Let&#8217;s take a look at the top 10 gaming cryptocurrencies in 2022:</strong></p>



<h2>1. <strong>Decentraland (MANA)</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/how-to-buy-mana-coin-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">MANA</a> is Decentraland’s crypto token, which is based on the Ethereum blockchain and is a growing blockchain-powered virtual world. This virtual environment, which was founded in 2017, can be explored and utilized as a basis for producing multiplayer games. Hundreds of 3D things are available in the Decentraland Builder, which may be utilized to build or manufacture nearly anything in this virtual environment as game tokens.</p>



<p>Players can purchase, sell, and exchange these game tokens. Users can also use these free and accessible marketplaces to buy and trade Decentraland-related virtual parcels. It&#8217;s no surprise that Decentraland is one of the most popular crypto coins. Players can also use MANA to purchase in-game products such as avatar costumes, as well as the opportunity to vote on future Decentraland developments. A single vote is represented by a single <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/MANA-INR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external">MANA token.</a></p>



<h2>2. <strong>Axie Infinity (AXS)</strong></h2>



<p>In <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/AXS-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Axie Infinity</a>, users purchase, breed, and pit monsters known as Axies against one another in order to win in-game currency known as little love potions, which may be converted for real money. It follows the Play-to-earn business strategy.</p>



<p>Each Axie is a non-fungible token (NFT), a one-of-a-kind collectable that can be purchased or sold on external exchanges. Players must have at least three Axies to start battles, with the lowest costing roughly $200, with the highest recorded being upwards of $130,000. On a regular basis, players can pay out their tokens. Small Love Potion (SLP) and Axie Infinity Shard are the two sorts of tokens in the game (AXS). The SLP is the currency that players frequently earn and cash out. The AXS is a planned governance token that, once implemented, will give owners a voice in how the game is developed.</p>



<h2>3. <strong>The Sandbox (SAND)</strong></h2>



<p>The Sandbox blockchain project based on Ethereum enables users to create and explore galaxies in a virtual universe. It used to be a mobile and PC game, but Animoca Brands bought it in August 2018. (and was brought into the blockchain sphere).</p>



<p>Players in the system can create and customize their own characters to access the Sandbox metaverse&#8217;s numerous landscapes, games, and hubs. The developed digital items can subsequently be monetized with NFTs and sold on the Sandbox Marketplace for <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/SAND-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">SAND tokens</a>. The Sandbox, unlike other popular play-to-earn games, does not have a predetermined gaming universe. Instead, it employs a dynamic approach that allows users to customize anything with free and simple design tools. SAND can be bought on <a href="https://wazirx.com/" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">WazirX</a>.</p>



<h2>4. <strong>Gala (GALA)</strong></h2>



<p>Gala Games is Gala&#8217;s full name, and GALA is the token&#8217;s name. It is based on Ethereum, and&nbsp; Eric Schiermeyer, one of the co-founders of mobile games business Zynga, which generated games like Mafia Wars and Farmville, founded it in 2019.</p>



<p>Gala has a user base of 1.3 million people. Its goal is to provide those consumers with more control over their gaming experiences. &#8220;The initiative intends to change the reality that players can spend hundreds of dollars on in-game items and countless hours playing the game, all of which can be taken away from them with the click of a button,&#8221; according to Coin Market Cap. Gala participants can possess NFTs (non-fungible tokens), which let them vote on new games and affect how they are run.</p>



<p>These NFTs, as well as in-game products, can be purchased using the <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/GALA-USDT" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">GALA token</a>. Currently, Gala One includes only one playable game, Town Star, and more games are currently in development.</p>



<h2>5. <strong>Flow &#8211; Dapper Labs (FLOW)</strong></h2>



<p>Dapper Labs, the organization behind the CryptoKitties blockchain game, released Flow in 2020. The Flow playground lets developers generate and exchange non-fungible tokens, a sort of digital asset. An NFT is similar to other crypto assets that may be purchased, sold, and traded without the use of a middleman over the internet. Dapper Labs is currently working on new platforms with Flow that will allow these types of applications to reach a wider audience.</p>



<p>Another cool aspect is that the team of developers behind <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/FLOW-USDT" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">FLOW token</a> has created this tool for aspiring devs to familiarise themselves with Cadence, the native language that is used to write Flow.</p>



<h2>6. Enjin Coin (ENJ)</h2>



<p>Enjin is a cryptocurrency first introduced in 2017 by the Enjin firm. It is an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency that supports both fungible and non-fungible tokens. Furthermore, since it is an ERC-20 compliant token, it can be transferred and received using an Ethereum wallet.</p>



<p>Enjin is a platform that lets users create, store, list, and trade NFTs all in one location. As it has developed as a platform with fewer expenses, most projects are interested in using it.</p>



<p>Apart from the tradable element, Enjin may also be used to purchase other in-game things such as accessories, weapons, etc.</p>



<h2>7. SushiSwap (SUSHI)</h2>



<p>Created in August 2020, <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/SUSHI-INR" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">SushiSwap</a> (SUSHI) is a decentralized exchange and digital token.</p>



<p>SushiSwap, being a decentralized exchange, employs an automated market-making system (AMM). It allows users to swap bitcoin tokens, but no central authority oversees the transactions. SushiSwap, on the other hand, calculates the price using mathematical methods and manages transactions using smart contracts.</p>



<p>Liquidity pools, or big pools of funds, are available at SushiSwap. Its members lend their crypto to these liquidity pools in exchange for rewards.</p>



<h2>8. RedFox Labs (RFOX)</h2>



<p>The RedFox Labs is a metaverse firm that invented the RFOX VALT, a comprehensive experience concentrating on buying, media, gaming, and incentives. RFOX has established an environment of solutions for e-games, Defi, NFTs, digital, and more, all connected into the metaverse, with RFOX VALT as the center point. The RFOX token serves as the ecosystem&#8217;s principal medium of exchange, while the VFOX token distributes a percentage of the RFOX VALT metaverse&#8217;s earnings to token holders. It is expected to be one of the most popular metaverse cryptocurrencies in 2022.</p>



<p>The RFOX token is a type of digital payment that investors and users may use to complete any transaction in the RFOX VALT metaverse, including creating and selling NFTs.</p>



<h2>9. DeRace ($DERC)</h2>



<p>DeRace — one of the most inventive play-to-earn metaverses – uses $DERC as its native token to power breeding and entrance fees. This NFT horse racing metaverse is a unique idea in which you may breed NFT horses with unique traits and compete in horse races.</p>



<p>DeRace has a large social media following and also assists you in building your hippodrome as a method to make extra $DERC aside from owning racehorses.</p>



<p>Users may buy NFTs representing a different horse because DeRace is a metaverse initiative. They may then establish their horse ownership, race it, put bets on it, and profit if their horse wins.</p>



<h2>10. Render (RNDR)</h2>



<p>The Render Network is a blockchain-based and crypto-enabled service that allows people to donate underutilized GPU capacity to companies that help them render motion graphics and visual effects. In exchange, users are provided the <a href="https://wazirx.com/exchange/RNDR-USDT" data-wpel-link="external" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Render Token</a> (RNDR), the network&#8217;s native utility token.</p>



<p>By constructing a peer-to-peer (P2P) network on which individuals and organizations may tap into spare computer resources affordably and effectively, Render substantially simplifies the traditional methods for rendering and streaming 3D environments and other visual effects. As a result, it&#8217;s an integral part of the metaverse&#8217;s next-generation digital products and services.</p>

<p>Facebook changed its name to Meta in 2021. The metaverse will be a big topic among many users throughout the world this year. Gamers are used to showing a passion in the digital world, where they may do or be whatever they want. You&#8217;ve come to the right place if you&#8217;re a gamer who has recently found Metaverse.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/the-metaverse-craze/" data-wpel-link="internal">Metaverse</a> is a large online community where you may meet new people and play games. This article discusses some of the top metaverse games as well as the fundamental criteria for playing them. But first, let&#8217;s define what the Metaverse is.</p>



<h2>Metaverse, in a nutshell</h2>



<p>Simply described, the metaverse is a virtual place that may represent either real-world space or the digital world. The film &#8220;Ready Player One&#8221; is a nice example, but the notion was initially popularized in 1992 by Neal Stephenson in his novel &#8220;Snow Crash.&#8221; In the metaverse, your digital avatar embodies you and all you do and own. It&#8217;s a virtual world that you may explore with or without an AR/VR headset.</p>



<p>The Metaverse is thought to be the most influential step into the virtual reality realm. As a result, corporations like Microsoft and Meta are increasing their research and development spending.</p>



<h2>How to get access to Metaverse games?</h2>



<ol><li><strong>A proper internet connection</strong></li></ol>



<p>The significant feature of the Metaverse is that it is always online. The Metaverse and its games will stay accessible even if you log out and sleep. In conclusion, it&#8217;s obvious that you&#8217;ll need a stable Internet connection to access the Metaverse. Before moving on, make sure you have this nailed down.</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>A VR headset</strong></li></ol>



<p>While the Metaverse is accessible via a variety of devices, the best method to play Metaverse games is with a virtual reality headset. Various types of VR sets may be supported depending on the game. However, for the finest Metaverse experience, I recommend getting your hands on an Oculus Quest 2.</p>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>PC or a mobile device</strong></li></ol>



<p>If you don&#8217;t want to buy a virtual reality headset to use in the Metaverse, you&#8217;ll be happy to hear that there are alternative options. You&#8217;ll need a mid-tier PC or a mobile or tablet device to play several Metaverse games. Make sure that you have all the above-mentioned items before you begin.</p>



<ol start="4"><li><strong>A Blockchain wallet</strong></li></ol>



<p>You&#8217;ll need a wallet if you wish to play a Blockchain-based Metaverse game. A BlockChain wallet, in essence, allows you to manage your bitcoins. This wallet will also allow you to trade stuff for cryptocurrencies with other players. Depending on the game you play, the wallet you use may change. To learn more, look into the play-to-earn games.</p>



<h2>5 best Metaverse games to play in 2022</h2>



<ol><li><strong>Sandbox</strong></li></ol>



<p>The Sandbox is one of the most prominent entries among the top metaverse games currently available. It provides a virtual environment in which you may create, own, and even benefit from monetization options in your game.</p>



<p>The Sandbox, being one of the most popular metaverse blockchain games, focuses on disrupting established games like Roblox and Minecraft. Sandbox is unusual in that it gives creators genuine ownership in the form of Non-Fungible Tokens or NFTs. Players are also rewarded for contributing to the game&#8217;s environment in the sandbox. Surprisingly, The Sandbox is one of the most popular metaverse games, with about a 7% market share.</p>



<p>The framework that allows users to create their own games in the metaverse is <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/the-sandbox-could-it-be-the-new-big-thing-in-the-metaverse/" data-wpel-link="internal">Sandbox</a>&#8216;s most remarkable feature.</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Axie Infinity</strong></li></ol>



<p>Axie Infinity is another famous metaverse blockchain game that deserves a mention. People may play the game to gain NFTs, which can then be traded for higher payouts. In recent years, the popularity of games like Axie Infinity has increased dramatically.</p>



<p>The fundamentals of Axie Infinity are based on Pokemon, where each digital collectible Axie is a unique species with distinct characteristics. You may also compete with other Axies in the game, gaining experience and collecting goodies. With a market price of $9 billion, Axie Infinity is one of the best adds to any metaverse games list.</p>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Sorare</strong></li></ol>



<p>Sorare is essentially a football NFT game built on the Ethereum blockchain&#8217;s underpinnings. Most importantly, almost 180 football clubs have officially registered on Sorare, with more clubs joining regularly.</p>



<p>Players may buy cards and create fantasy teams on Sorare. The cards represent real players, and their performance in real matches may aid cardholders in winning points. As a reward, the teams with the highest points would be able to create new cards every week.</p>



<p>Anyone with an email address may make a free account in the game and begin playing immediately. Sorare NFT cards could be purchased with debit or credit cards, as well as bank transfers.</p>



<ol start="4"><li><strong>Illuvium</strong></li></ol>



<p>Illuvium occupies a unique position among the metaverse games&#8217; major billion-dollar participants. It&#8217;s essentially an open-world role-playing game built on the Ethereum blockchain. The basic principle of the game is to explore the large virtual environment it contains. The main objective of the game is for players to collect powerful entities known as &#8220;Illuvials.&#8221; The most amazing aspect of Illuvium as one of the best metaverse games is that it has yet to be released.</p>



<p>Illuvium, which is set to start in the first quarter of 2022, has already amassed a $1 billion market valuation. The bulk of Illuvium talks includes footage from the actual game. Illuvium&#8217;s major strengths, according to metaverse fans, are its amazing visuals and engaging gameplay. Illuvium&#8217;s realistic gameplay experience may work to its advantage and attract a large user base.</p>



<ol start="5"><li><strong>Ultra</strong></li></ol>



<p>Ultra would undoubtedly enter the equation as the concluding addition to a range of online metaverse games. It is most likely the first blockchain ecosystem to power a gaming platform that includes blockchain-enabled services.</p>



<p>Along with engaging in tournaments and events, participants may communicate with their favorite influencers and watch live-stream broadcasts. Ultra has its own native ERC-20 coin, $UOS. Staking with a $UOS token earns you super-rare NFTs as a reward.</p>



<p>The nicest part about Ultra is its versatility in terms of gaming and trading on NFT platforms. By using new <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-problems-can-defi-solve/" data-wpel-link="internal">DeFi</a> apps, the platform might also let customers interact with entertainment offerings.</p>



<p>Simply download the Ultra wallet, and you&#8217;ll be able to register an account and get started straight away.</p>



<h2>Bottom line</h2>



<p>The metaverse is unquestionably expanding, and this is the case. As a result, it&#8217;s realistic to expect the finest metaverse games to garner a lot of attention in the future years.</p>



<p>Numerous aficionados, on the other hand, are ready to jump on board before it&#8217;s too late. Metaverse games, which allow participants to direct their personal gaming experience, incorporate NFTs into the mix.</p>



<p>Moreover, many of the most renowned metaverse games are still in development phases. On the other hand, the new games&#8217; intriguing gameplay experience and features may offer up new opportunities for individuals that engage.</p>

<p>Ethereum is without a doubt the second most popular and valuable cryptocurrency on the market. After Bitcoin, it has the largest market capitalization. As a consequence, many people regard it as a good financial tool. In addition, several new technologies, like <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/the-pros-and-cons-of-nft-art/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFT</a>, dApps, and others, are being created around Ethereum. However, how does Ethereum gain its intrinsic value?</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s begin with the most fundamental question: What is Ethereum?</p>



<h2>What’s Ethereum?</h2>



<p>Ethereum is a blockchain network that is decentralized. It uses a peer-to-peer network to securely run and verify application code. Smart contracts are the name for this type of application code.</p>



<p>Smart contracts allow you to transact with other users without the need for a central trust authority such as a bank or a court. Furthermore, the transaction records are unchangeable and provable. Furthermore, these transaction records are dispersed across the network. As a consequence, you&#8217;ll have complete control over and visibility over transaction data.</p>



<p>These transactions are transmitted and received using ethereum accounts, which you must create first. You must also sign the transaction and pay a processing fee in ether or ETH currency.</p>



<h2>How does Ethereum get its intrinsic value?</h2>



<p>The gas fee is one of the key reasons behind Ethereum&#8217;s intrinsic value. When you transmit ETH to someone, you must pay a transaction fee for a particular quantity of currency. This is referred to as a gas charge.</p>



<p>You will have to pay gas fees while sending ERC-20 tokens. When sending an ERC-20 token, however, the sender must also have ETH in the same wallet to complete the transaction. Furthermore, when trading on DEXs, you will be required to pay gas costs.</p>



<p>As a result, many people believe that storing ETH tokens for gas costs is a good idea. And it is because of this that the coin has a base-level demand in the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>According to the statistics, Ethereum&#8217;s network witnessed a lot of traffic during the DeFi surge in 2020. As a result, the Ethereum network was able to generate a sizable gas fee.</p>



<h2>4 reasons why Ethereum has intrinsic value</h2>



<ol><li><strong>Smart contracts capability</strong></li></ol>



<p>Ethereum was established as a platform for programmatically running smart contracts and apps using its own currency, ether.</p>



<p>The Ethereum blockchain can run smart contracts that allow decentralized apps (DApps) like decentralized finance (DeFi) or nonfungible currencies, resulting in real-world use cases that are currently gaining traction and retaining value (NFTs).</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>A new kind of connectivity</strong></li></ol>



<p>Ethereum is a type of architecture that has the potential to revolutionize both finance and technology.</p>



<p>DeFi has the potential to profoundly transform the financial industry. Ethereum-based apps will have an influence on markets, governance, public services, and maybe even identity management. In the future, the Ethereum platform may be used to transform mortgage transfers, securities trading, and a range of other industries.</p>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>A shift to the Proof-of-Stake model</strong></li></ol>



<p>Bitcoin and Ethereum, both employ the proof-of-work consensus at the moment. To verify and validate transactions, miners, who are paid for processing transactions and conducting smart contracts, must establish a network-wide consensus.</p>



<p>Ethereum is developing on a proof-of-stake architecture, termed <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-does-the-future-of-ethereum-hold-in-india/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum 2.0</a>, that will change the rewards system dramatically.</p>



<p>If Ethereum 2.0 is a success, the blockchain will be able to handle a greater number of transactions. This scalability is required if Ethereum is to play a substantial role in the global financial system while simultaneously being more environmentally sustainable than proof-of-work alternatives like bitcoin.</p>



<ol start="4"><li><strong>Scalability and speed</strong></li></ol>



<p>According to two fundamental parameters, Ethereum is quite different from bitcoin. Ethereum block times are now between 10 and 15 seconds, relative to 10 minutes for bitcoin; also, each ether transaction takes about five minutes to process, but bitcoin transactions take around 40 minutes.</p>



<p>The proposed Ethereum 2.0 upgrade will allow for faster transactions, among other things. The Beacon chain, which is part of that update, uses shard chains, which are smaller groupings of nodes that process their own sections of transactions in parallel without needing to establish a network-wide agreement. This is intended to greatly enhance Ethereum&#8217;s scalability and throughput rate.</p>



<p>The Ethereum 2.0 throughput rate is predicted to exceed 15,000 transactions per second, allowing Ethereum to match the transaction processing speed of any centralized payment system.</p>



<h2>Final thoughts on Ether futures</h2>



<p>In February 2021, CME Group, a renowned cryptocurrency futures exchange, added Ether futures to its range of cryptocurrency products.</p>



<p>Since the beginning, about 320,000 Ether futures contracts have been <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/best-tips-to-know-for-successful-ethereum-trading/" data-wpel-link="internal">traded</a>. The contract is being used by market participants to get access to the token and hedge ether&#8217;s price risk, leading in significant organizational adoption and larger trading volume than Bitcoin futures.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s the type of market activity to keep an eye on as players gain a deeper understanding of all the applications and use cases for this ground-breaking digital currency.</p>

<p>CryptoKitties are among the first collectible NFTs to hit the market, and a segment of the cryptocurrency world has continued to be interested in them.</p>



<p>CryptoKitties, built on the Ethereum blockchain, were the forerunners of collectibles such as NBA Top Shot (also by Dapper Labs), CryptoPunks, and Sorare. CryptoKitties was Ethereum&#8217;s first official game application, and for a while, it accounted for a significant portion of Ethereum transactions.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s take a closer look at this fascinating topic.</p>



<h2>What are CryptoKitties?</h2>



<p>Axiom Zen, a Canadian firm, launched CryptoKitties in December 2017. Axiom Zen works on various initiatives, including software development and virtual reality, but CryptoKitties has been one of their most successful to date!</p>



<p>The creators attempted to make an <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/best-tips-to-know-for-successful-ethereum-trading/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum</a> game that allowed anybody on the globe to own virtual cats produced by smart contracts. Each cat manufactured is one-of-a-kind, with various colored fur, eyes, and hair!</p>



<p>Different CryptoKitty genders are also available, each named after a male or female horse! For example, a male CryptoKitty is known as a Sire, while females are known as Dames!</p>



<p>Although CryptoKitties is referred to as a game, you can only buy, breed, and sell them.</p>



<p>Some cats are considerably uncommon, and they may fetch a high price. For example, people have spent more than $100,000 for a single cat in certain situations!</p>



<p>Do you remember collecting a pack of Pokémon cards in the hopes of getting a rare card like Charizard? CryptoKitties is similar in that new kittens are produced randomly from a smart contract code when they are formed!</p>



<h2>Advancements of CryptoKitties</h2>



<ul><li>Axiom Zen created Cryptokitties in 2017. These virtual cat assets are held on the Ethereum blockchain, which uses smart contracts to allow gamers to buy, collect, breed, and sell their virtual cats. All Cryptokitty transactions are done in Ether because the app was created on the Ethereum network.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The first Cryptokitty, Genesis, was sold for 246.9255 ETH, valued at around USD 117,712.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The game was so popular after it was released that it clogged the Ethereum network with so many transactions. Users have already purchased almost USD 1 million worth of virtual pets just a few days after the introduction.</li></ul>



<h2>How does CryptoKitties work?</h2>



<p>CryptoKitties are <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-nft-minting/" data-wpel-link="internal">Non-Fungible Tokens</a> (NFTs) created using the ERC721 token standard on the Ethereum network. Before the introduction of ERC721, blockchain tokens were fungible or interchangeable; every Bitcoin or Ethereum token is identical to any other. ERC721 enabled the development of non-fungible, one-of-a-kind tokens.</p>



<p>Using smart contracts and ERC721 tokens, CryptoKitties was created to evaluate the notion of digital scarcity.</p>



<p>Each and every CryptoKitty has its digital genome, stored in a smart contract. Any two CryptoKitties can be bred, and an offspring with its distinct features is developed via a genetic algorithm (or &#8220;cattributes&#8221;). The smart contract&#8217;s external appearance, or phenotype, is determined by its unchangeable genotype.</p>



<h2>What is the best way to purchase CryptoKitties?</h2>



<p>To get started with your CryptoKitty, you&#8217;ll need a PC or mobile device, a crypto wallet like MetaMask, and some Ethereum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All you have to do now is go to the CryptoKitties marketplace, set up an account, choose a cat you like, and hit &#8220;buy now.&#8221;</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll be met with a Dapper transaction window where you may complete your purchase if you have enough ETH in your wallet.</p>



<p>You may also bid on a CryptoKitty that isn&#8217;t for sale, but the owner has the final say on whether or not to accept your offer.</p>



<h2>What is the best way to breed CryptoKitties?</h2>



<p>All you need is a breeding couple to start breeding CryptoKitty; either one can be the Sire or Dame. After breeding, the Sire will need a little restoration period, which will get longer each time they sire. While harboring your new kitten, the Dame will be unable to breed.</p>



<p>Click on one of your Kitties in your litter, then press the &#8220;Breed&#8221; button that appears; this will be the Sire. Then select a cat to act as Dame and click &#8220;OK, give them some privacy&#8221; to launch a <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/difference-between-on-chain-off-chain-transactions/" data-wpel-link="internal">transaction</a> window, and you&#8217;ll have your very own bouncing baby CryptoKitty in no time.</p>



<p>Alternatively, you may breed one of your cats with a public sire for a nominal transaction charge.</p>



<h2>The future of CryptoKitties</h2>



<p>In addition to raising and purchasing cats, you may now participate in catfights and compete on leader boards in the Cryptokitties (or Kittyverse) universe.</p>



<p>Cryptokitties boosted the popularity of Crypto-collectables, also known as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). People&#8217;s understanding of what a blockchain may be used for grew due to Cryptokitties&#8217; immense success and popularity, leading to a rush of comparable crypto-collectibles and digital things that we can trade online.</p>

<h2>Blockchain interoperability: In a nutshell</h2>



<p>The term &#8220;blockchain interoperability&#8221; refers to the capacity of multiple blockchain networks to share and exchange data and move different forms of digital assets between their separate blockchains. Once diverse blockchain networks and assets are connected and merged in an interoperable system, they can readily plug into and combine.</p>



<p>This network interoperability might pave the way for developing innovative new goods and services that combine the advantages of many blockchain networks.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s look at the notion of blockchain interoperability in more detail.</p>



<h2>An introduction to blockchain interoperability</h2>



<p>The phrase &#8220;blockchain interoperability&#8221; comprises two words: blockchain and interoperability. Where <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-is-the-blockchain-trilemma/" data-wpel-link="internal">blockchain</a> is defined as a method of storing data so that it is difficult or impossible to alter, hack, or deceive it.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s check what does interoperability mean and what does it imply?</p>



<p>Interoperability may be described as the capacity to perform many operations of the same type. The mechanism of functions between two or more blockchains is termed blockchain interoperability. In layman&#8217;s terms, it is the mechanism that allows two or more blockchains to communicate.</p>



<p>Blockchain interoperability may be described as the capacity to see, access, and exchange data across several blockchains or blockchain networks. Interoperability is something that many blockchain initiatives aspire to incorporate to make their processes more accessible and more transparent. In addition, putting this mechanism in place will boost the communication pace of their blockchains.</p>



<p>Different types of data and transactions are stored on each blockchain. Interoperability allows blockchains to share and access data while also communicating with one another. Blockchain interoperability refers to the capacity for blockchains to share and communicate with one another.</p>



<h2>Significance of blockchain interoperability</h2>



<p>The ability of multiple blockchain networks to communicate and integrate will determine the success of blockchain technology. As a result, blockchain interoperability refers to various blockchains sharing to facilitate information exchange.</p>



<p>The potential to see and access the data across many blockchain systems is known as interoperability. For example, if someone sends data to another blockchain, shouldn&#8217;t the receiver be able to read, interpret, and react to it with minimal effort? However, this is currently impossible because information cannot be transferred across the Bitcoin and <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/ethereum-a-short-term-or-long-term-investment/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum</a> blockchains.</p>



<p>This is addressed by cross-chain technology, which aims to improve interoperability across blockchains. As they attempt to establish platforms that allow users to communicate with one another without using a third party, emerging initiatives are progressively adopting the notion.</p>



<p>Interoperability on the blockchain should help eliminate the need for intermediaries or third parties associated with centralized systems. Furthermore, multiple decentralized networks&#8217; ability to communicate with one another without the necessity of intermediaries should assist in the development of genuinely decentralized systems.</p>



<p><strong>But why is that?</strong></p>



<p>Interoperability of blockchains is critical since it will make it easier for individuals to transact on other blockchains seamlessly. You can only interact on one blockchain at a time, which is either Bitcoin or Ethereum. It is, however, impossible to transmit data across two separate chains.</p>



<p>Because of the interoperability of blockchains, a variety of functionalities should emerge. For example, users will be able to make payments across several blockchains. In the future, a fully functional blockchain interoperability venture should be at the center of the digital economy.</p>



<p>Due to the emergence of multi-token wallet systems. Users will be able to rely on a single wallet system for token storage and transfer across several blockchains due to this breakthrough.</p>



<h2>Advantages of blockchain interoperability</h2>



<p>Following are the advantages of blockchain interoperability that you should consider.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Customized Web3 services</strong></li></ol>



<p>The flexibility of blockchain protocols and apps to mix and match different &#8220;lego pieces&#8221; is critical to developing new Web3 instruments and platforms that aren&#8217;t conceivable with legacy industries and business models from the Web2 era.</p>



<p>Many experts believe that interoperable smart contracts have the potential to transform sectors such as healthcare, law, and real estate by allowing essential business data to be transmitted back and forth across private and public networks in a configurable and controllable manner.</p>



<p>Multi-token transactions and wallet systems may be enabled through blockchain interoperability in the future, dramatically simplifying the crypto user experience.</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>A highly decentralized ecosystem</strong></li></ol>



<p>While many blockchain initiatives prioritize pure decentralization inside individual blockchain networks, the capacity to develop network interoperability between various blockchains is an even more progressive realization of blockchain technology&#8217;s promise to decentralize institutions and economies.</p>



<p>Thousands of application-specific blockchains might one day connect through a decentralized primary hub rather than one blockchain like Ethereum processing all transactions for thousands of <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/a-beginners-guide-to-dapps/" data-wpel-link="internal">decentralized apps</a> (dApps).</p>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Improved cross-industry collaboration</strong></li></ol>



<p>The significant benefits of blockchain technology are data openness and verifiability, smart contract execution, and decentralized consensus, which have a wide range of industry-specific applications.</p>



<p>Independent marketplaces and business applications that were previously deemed wholly distinct will be able to more readily transfer data and value if blockchains utilized by different companies and industries can connect.</p>



<p>This implies that enterprises and communities that don&#8217;t usually connect will be able to share information, use one another&#8217;s strengths, and promote creativity more quickly and efficiently.</p>



<h2>Disadvantages of blockchain interoperability</h2>



<p>Following are the disadvantages of blockchain interoperability.</p>



<ol><li><strong>The reverse flow of blockchain is not viable.</strong></li></ol>



<p>A blockchain that has been registered on a network is unable to return to its original place. As a result, validating the information before submitting a beginning node is critical.</p>



<ol start="2"><li><strong>Interoperability between two networks is not possible.</strong></li></ol>



<p>Interoperability across blockchains within the same network is presently possible. However, Ethereum and Ripple, for example, cannot communicate with one another. This flaw must be addressed soon to ensure a bright future for blockchain interoperability worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<ol start="3"><li><strong>Highly restricted</strong></li></ol>



<p>The interoperability of blockchains is a highly constrained procedure. Though this function protects data security when sending data, it may also make things more difficult for users.</p>



<h2>Concluding thoughts</h2>



<p>Interoperability is required for blockchain to attain widespread acceptance across multiple industries. More than just moving crypto assets between blockchains necessitates interoperability. However, it must now make it easier to share other types of data, such as financial records, supply chain records, certifications, etc. Cross-chain solutions are still in the early stages of development, but they are a promising indicator of a future with improved blockchain interoperability options. As diverse blockchain protocols and IT behemoths envisage the route to blockchain disruption through interoperability, optimism reigns supreme.</p>

<p>The Internet allowed the entire globe to be connected. It did not, however, instill confidence in it. The presence of solid intermediaries aggregating power is due to a lack of trust in our society. The digital world cannot take over because of a lack of trust. Organizations suffer due to this inefficiency, as time, energy, money, and passion are squandered, ensuring that everything goes as planned.</p>



<p>In this situation, managers serve as intermediates, connecting specialists and instructing them on what to do. As a result, people&#8217;s involvement in our expert society is minimal since no one is there to encourage and empower them. In other words, our community is experiencing a remarkable absence of leadership.</p>



<p>However, when it comes to implementing <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/impact-of-blockchain-technology-on-the-digital-economy/" data-wpel-link="internal">blockchain technology</a> in such firms, it is expected that the technology would usher in a revolution in the sector by automating numerous managerial processes and assisting executives in making more informed choices.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s look at how Blockchain technology affects management and leadership.</p>



<h2>Leadership and management</h2>



<p>Management is described as the procedure of planning, organizing, directing, and controlling activities of employees in accordance with other resources to achieve organizational objectives. Finally, leadership is defined as a social correlation between two or more people who rely on each other to achieve specific mutual goals in a group situation.</p>



<p>So, in a sense, management is putting the leadership theory into practice.</p>



<p>People are a common aspect of both leadership and management. There will be no leaders or managers if there are no people. People are at the heart of leadership and management, and how effectively exceptional leaders and managers deal with the people they work with is an accurate measure of their abilities.</p>



<h2>The Trust Factor</h2>



<p>On the other hand, trust is a lifetime concern that has existed for as long as people have existed. Every human transaction necessitates the establishment of trust.</p>



<p>Any effective connection, both personal and professional, is built on trust, and once it is destroyed, it is exceedingly challenging to rebuild. When employees believe they can&#8217;t trust their bosses, they feel uncomfortable, as if no one is looking out for them, and they focus more on self-preservation and job-seeking than on their work.</p>



<p>A lack of confidence in leadership is a sign that the company&#8217;s culture is &#8220;toxic.&#8221; Nobody wants to work every day and feel like they&#8217;re entering a toxic trash dump. Employees will complete the task assigned to them, but they are unlikely to go above and beyond to assist in the creation of a high-performance company if they lack faith in leadership. Therefore, TRUST is one of the most critical aspects of leadership and management.</p>



<p>Trust is essential for leaders and the people they lead to work together effectively. Engagement and open cooperation are critical for building trust. People-oriented and technically competent leaders and managers enable others to work actively toward strategic goals. Openness and communication suffer as a result of a lack of trust. Reduced openness and communication result in a lack of creativity, agility, and adaptability to changing circumstances. This will affect profit margins.</p>



<h2>How is Blockchain technology helping to bridge the leadership and management gap??</h2>



<p>The internet era arrived, bringing the ability to link the whole world with it. It did not, however, instill confidence in it. The emergence of solid intermediaries aggregating power is due to a lack of confidence in our culture. As a result, organizations squander a lot of time, energy, money, and passion verifying what&#8217;s going on.</p>



<p>Thanks to Blockchain Technology, the trust gap is closing, which has given rise to a new platform for commercial relationships that combines ease of use, cheap cost, and excellent security. Moreover, it establishes a new foundation of confidence for corporate interactions, which might lead to significant economic simplicity and acceleration.</p>



<p>Value creation is reconfigured using blockchain technology, with professionals immediately working with one another and abolishing hierarchies. As a result, managers may become redundant as a blockchain infrastructure automates most work. As a result, the organization can only be kept together by robust and action-oriented <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/crypto-the-new-age-of-entrepreneurship/" data-wpel-link="internal">leadership</a>. This leadership-in-action would entail motivating individuals to take action and coaching members of organizations to ensure that their contributions are meaningful in the larger context of life.</p>



<h2>Final thoughts</h2>



<p>There are several advantages to employing this type of technology, whether you are a small or large business. Blockchain has the potential to transform businesses. It provides several benefits, including higher security, transparency, efficiency, traceability, and transaction speed.</p>

<p>Bitcoin has caught the globe by storm since its inception in 2009. The rise in popularity of Bitcoin may be attributed to several factors, including its ease of use and reliability as a payment mechanism. Bitcoin allows you to send money to other people quickly, easily, and securely, and it is decentralized. In addition, the network&#8217;s decentralized design provides for improved openness and trust.</p>



<p>Bitcoin uses the <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/blockchain-a-boon-to-strengthen-indian-dynamism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Blockchain</a> as a ledger to keep track of all network transactions. Rather than relying on a single centralized server, it employs a network of nodes, with each transaction being validated, recorded, and disseminated among them. Since there are no regulatory organizations or time-consuming documentation involved, overhead and the possibility of mistakes are eliminated.</p>



<p>However, the picture isn&#8217;t entirely rosy. The expenses connected with the transaction, which can accumulate during network congestion, are one of the trade-offs that come with security. In addition, during moments of high traffic, processing speeds might grind to an unacceptably sluggish pace. Taking some Bitcoin transactions off the Blockchain may simplify, speed up, and reduce the cost of your transactions.</p>



<p>This raises the question of whether on-chain or off-chain transactions are preferable. In this blog, we&#8217;ll learn about the differences between them.</p>



<h2>What are on-chain transactions?</h2>



<p>Transactions that take place on the Blockchain are known as on-chain transactions. It is the more common of the two transaction types, and it necessitates a blockchain network upgrade.</p>



<p>A certain number of confirmations by miners is required to complete an on-chain transaction. The time it takes to perform an on-chain transaction is also affected by network congestion. As a result, if there is a significant volume of transactions to be confirmed, transactions may be delayed. You may, however, pay a more substantial cost if you want them to finish sooner. Only when more than 51% of the network&#8217;s members agree that a transaction is correct and the ledger is fully updated do on-chain transactions become implemented (and irreversible).</p>



<h2>What are off-chain transactions?</h2>



<p>The second type of blockchain transaction is off-chain transactions. They are distinct from on-chain transactions in several respects.</p>



<p>Transaction agreements that take place off the Blockchain are known as off-chain transactions. Off-chain transactions are handled using a mechanism similar to that used on payment platforms.</p>



<p>The participants in the transaction have the option of reaching an agreement outside of the Blockchain. For example, a third party may be involved in the following stage to validate the transaction&#8217;s completion and verify that the deal has been followed. As a result, the third party acts as a transaction guarantee.</p>



<p>This is the approach used by the majority of decentralized exchanges today, in which the exchange acts as an escrow. First, it offers the transaction platform and regulations. Then, the actual transaction is conducted on the Blockchain once the parties have agreed on conditions outside the Blockchain.</p>



<p>In many circumstances, off-chain transactions can benefit from codes or discounts. These are redeemable codes or vouchers that may be redeemed for cryptocurrency. The third party is in charge of holding the codes or coupons and redeeming them at the appropriate time.</p>



<p>Off-chain transactions can also be carried out by the parties exchanging <a href="https://wazirx.com/blog/what-are-crypto-wallet-private-keys/" data-wpel-link="internal">private keys</a>. The crypto assets engaged will not abandon the wallets if this method is used. The ownership of the asset is changed without affecting the Blockchain. As a result, the transaction is immediate and without delay.</p>



<h2>On-chain transactions Vs. off-chain transactions</h2>



<p>Off-chain transactions are transactions that take place outside of the blockchain network. Off-chain transactions are when participants agree that a third party will ensure or validate the transaction&#8217;s authenticity or completion. The two parties may, for example, trade their private keys, allowing them to swap crypto assets without having to transfer any money from their e-wallets.</p>



<p>On the other hand, off-chain transactions take happen without affecting the Blockchain. As a result, blockchain miners are no longer necessary to wait to validate transactions, lowering transaction fees and speeding up the process. Off-chain transactions are likewise not recorded on the Blockchain; therefore, there is no network log of the transaction or financial information available in the event of a dispute between the parties.</p>



<p>On the other hand, on-chain transactions are executed on the blockchain network and are irreversible. Although on-chain transactions take substantially longer due to the validation process employed by miners, having the transaction confirmed by participants and published on the blockchain network enhances security significantly.</p>



<p>Off-chain transactions have nothing to do with cryptocurrencies; on-chain transactions, on the other hand, are ideal for bitcoin transfers. The use of Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs) is an excellent example of this. A DID might be public domain data linked to the public in the same manner that Bitcoin is.</p>



<p>On the other hand, DID is linked to PII (Personally Identifiable Information). It&#8217;s kept on a sidechain that only you have access to. On the Blockchain, you have total control over your identity data, allowing you to choose who, when, where, and how you disclose your PII data.</p>



<h2>Final thoughts</h2>



<p>There are several considerations to consider when selecting whether to finish transactions on or off the Blockchain. Off-chain transactions are excellent for people searching for quick, cheap, and discreet transactions. On the other hand, on-chain transactions may be preferable for those desiring security, validity, and immutability. Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of both on-chain and off-chain transactions and what you want and need from your payment experience will assist you in making the proper selection for your requirements.</p>
